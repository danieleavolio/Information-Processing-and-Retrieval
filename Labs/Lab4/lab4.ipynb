In addition, the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2 scoring systems.  Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22. The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly changed compared with matched control persons.  Notably IgG and IgA were elevated and the \"acute phase proteins\" were changed, the latter suggesting active tissue damage.  The concentrations of 3 of the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins. The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on the tissue of the respiratory tract.\\n',\n",
       " 'Salivary amylase levels were determined in normal subjects from birth until adult life and in children with conditions sometimes associated with low pancreatic amylase such as malnutrition, coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis.  Mixed saliva was collected under carefully standardised conditions and amylase was measured by the method of Dahlqvist.  There was a wide scatter of values in the 84 normal subjects, but concentrations rose from very low levels at birth to reach adult levels by the age of 6 months to 1 year. Salivary amylase activity rose normally over ten weeks in one premature infant fed milk by gastrostomy.  Thirteen children with coeliac disease and 9 children with cystic fibrosis mostly had normal salivary amylase concentrations.  Six out of 12 malnourished children with jejunal villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology had low levels which rose to normal as recovery began.\\n',\n",
       " 'This article reports on the possibility of using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of sodium in nail clippings for diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) in children and adults, for detecting heterozygotes and for screening in the neonatal period. Nail clippings from 1322 newborns, 22 CF patients (two of them newborns), 52 healthy controls and 22 heterozygotes were analyzed. The discrimination between CF patients and controls was found to be precise for individuals above one year of age and INAA of nail clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for CF after this age.  Heterozygotes could not be detected by the method.  During the first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values from normal newborns and those of CF children, which makes the method invaluable for early screening for CF.\\n',\n",
       " 'Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of nail clippings was used in the development of a diagnostic method for cystic fibrosis (CF).  From CF patients and controls more than three years old, nail clippings were sampled for tests of different errors.  As a result of this study a precise collection routine was outlined. Sodium is easily washed out from nail clippings.  The risk of sodium contamination of the nails seems to be small.  The sodium distribution in the nail is inhomogeneous, and the sodium content varies also from nail to nail in the same person.  There is good evidence that the increased sodium in the nails of CF patients comes from the sweat.  There seems to be a basic \"intrinsic\" sodium level, which is about the same in the nails of CF patients as in controls. The precision and accuracy of INAA for determining sodium in nails is considered satisfactory.  It is concluded that INAA of the sodium concentration in nail clippings is a suitable method as an aid in the diagnosis of CF if a precise collection routine is used.\\n',\n",

The proteolytic activity per ml duodenal juice in fasting condition was as great in healthy infants and children as healthy adults (500-600 mg casein/ml/hour).  There was a good correlation between trypsin content and proteolytic activity of duodenal juice.  In pancreatic insufficiency, the proteolytic activity was extremely low (not measurable in 3 patients) as was the trypsin activity whereas in enterogenic malabsorption, it was within the ranges of the controls.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The influence of chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection on the occurrence of bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) and thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) in peripheral blood have been studied in 2 groups of patients with cystic fibrosis.  One group (9 patients) suffered from chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection in the respiratory tract and produced multiple Ps. aeruginosa precipitins which were demonstrated by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis.  The other group (9 patients) had never harboured Ps. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract and presented no demonstrable precipitins against this bacteria.  The lymphocytes were examined for the presence of 2 surface markers for B cells: receptor for C3 complement component (EAC rosette-formation) and surface immunoglobulins (immunofluorescent staining), and for the presence of 1 surface marker for T cells: spontaneous binding of sheep red blood cells (E rosette-formation).  The B:T cell ratio was nearly identical in the 2 groups of patients whereas the total numbers of B and T cells were significant higher in patients with chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection.  The number of Ps. aeruginosa precipitins per serum was significantly positively correlated to the total number of T cells, wheras the correlation with the total number of B cells was insignificant.\\n',\n",
       " 'The occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the respiratory tract of 70 cystic fibrosis patients and the occurrence of precipitins against Ps. aeruginosa in sera from the same patients have been investigated during one year by means of monthly bacteriological examinations of tracheal secretions and by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis of a polyvalent Ps. aeruginosa antigen against sera from the patients.  The one-year period prevalence rate of patients harbouring Ps. aeruginosa was 64 per cent.  In newly colonized patients and in intermittently colonized patients non-mucoid strains were predominating, whereas mucoid strains were predominating in chronically colonized patients.  The occurrence of mucoid strains, especially in chronically colonized patients, was associated with a significantly higher number of precipitins against Ps. aeruginosa than the occurrence of non-mucoid strains.  Males chronically colonized with mucoid strains presented a significantly higher number of precipitins than females chronically colonized with mucoid strains and the number of precipitins was correlated with the duration of the chronic colonization with Ps. aeruginosa in males in contrast to females.  The results are in accordance with the hypothesis that mucoid substance could be a virulence factor because it might inhibit the opsonizing effect of the precipitins on the mucoid cells and the complement dependent lysis of the cells hereby favouring mucoid strains at the expense on non-mucoid strains in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'Seventy patients with cystic fibrosis treated as out-patients in a cystic fibrosis clinic have been followed during one year by monthly bacteriological examinations of tracheal secretions.  The daily impression obtained in the laboratory is expressed by the mean point prevalence rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 44 per cent, Staphylococcus aureus: 39 per cent, Haemophilus influenzae: 17 per cent, Diplococcus pneumoniae: 8 per cent, and miscellaneous other bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae: 8 per cent.  The fluctuations of the bacteriology are described by additional epidemiological terms: At one or more examinations during the study (period prevalence rate), 90 per cent of the patients harboured St. aureus, 64 per cent Ps. aeruginosa (mainly mucoid strains), 64 per cent H. influenzae, 37 per cent D. pneumoniae, and 30 per cent miscellaneous other bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae.  This pattern was found in all age groups with minor age-dependent modifications, especially as regards Enterobacteriaceae.  Ps. aeruginosa was predominating as regards chronic colonization which reflects the most difficult therapeutic problems, the period prevalence rate being 39 per cent in contrast to St. aureus: 10 per cent, and H. influenzae: 1 per cent.  St. aureus was predominating as regards new colonization and recolonization which reflect the problems of prevention, the incidence rate of new colonization and recolonization per risk group being 84 per cent, followed by H. influenzae: 62 per cent, Ps. aeruginosa: 43 per cent, and D. pneumoniae: 30 per cent.  The results show that the bacteriological problems in cystic fibrosis are still considerable as regards therapy as well as prevention. Although many species may colonize the respiratory tracts of these patients, the main clinical problems concern Ps. aeruginosa and St. aureus; the reason why is discussed.\\n',\n",

Fifteen patients (24%) had respiratory allergies as defined by history, physical examination, positive allergy skin tests, nasal and peripheral eosinophilia, and reversible airway obstruction.  Serum immunoglobulins on these 15 allergic CF and 22 nonallergic CF patients were elevated when compared with those in normal age-matched controls.  The allergic CF patients had significantly higher IgE levels (mean 598 international units [IU] compared to 281 IU); IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were similar in the two CF groups.  The clinical condition of the allergic CF patients, (Shwachman score) was better than the nonallergic, suggesting some modulating effect of respiratory allergy on the severity of the disease.\\n',\n",

       " \"Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders has received increasing attention during the past several years.  Rapid expansion of our knowledge of the basis of genetic disease and the development of reliable diagnostic methods have led to rapid advances in the intrauterine diagnosis of a large number of inherited disorders. Prenatal diagnosis was initially used to determine the presence of Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities and for the determination of fetal sex in pregnancies at risk for a number of severe X-linked recessive disorders.  Shortly thereafter, it became clear that the same techniques could be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of a number of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Most recently, a number of new techniques have been developed that may prove to be of great value in the prenatal diagnosis of a number of severe congenital malformations that before now could not be diagnosed prior to birth.  The goal of this review is to define the past achievements, future goals, and present limitations of intrauterine diagnosis.  The first section will deal with the general approaches used in prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders.  This will be followed by a discussion of the specific applications of the basic techniques to the intrauterine diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Approaches to prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, direct and indirect visualization of the fetus, analysis of maternal blood and urine, and sampling of fetal tissues.  Applications of prenatal genetic diagnosis include X-linked recessive disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, disorders of lipid metabolism, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, disorders of mucopolysaccharide metabolism, disorders of amino acid metabolism, and miscellaneous disorders such as cystic fibrosis.  These techniques provide some parents with methods for having children without fear of having a child with a specific deformity.  In addition to the development of approaches which will increase the number of disorders detectable in utero, the potential for treatment of genetic disorders is unlimited.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Three of the 4 women in a cystic fibrosis clinic who used a combined form of oral contraceptive developed acute polypoid cervicitis.  In one woman, the polyp recurred on reinstitution of the medication. There was resolution of the polyp in each instance on discontinuation of the drugs.  In 2 of the 3 affected women, there was coincidental deterioration of respiratory status.  Therefore, it is suggested that cystic fibrosis patients who are using oral contraception be observed closely regarding pulmonary and gynecologic status.\\n',\n",
       " 'The syndrome of ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by ataxia, progressive neurologic degeneration, cutaneous and conjunctival telangiectasis, and immunologic deficiency.  Roentgenologic evidence of chronic pulmonary and sinus infections and decreased lymphoid tissue will usually be present.  As the sinopulmonary abnormalities resemble those of cystic fibrosis, a small adenoidal mass may be of differential aid.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is no longer rare in adults.  The lung is the main target organ and the basic lesion is bronchial obstruction leading to bronchiectasis.  Interstitial infiltrates and cyst-like changes are characteristic on roentgenography.  Complications include pulmonary hypertension, pneumonitis, hemorrhage, and pneumothorax.  Little correlation exists between respiratory tract and pancreatic and gastrointestinal involvement, despite similarities in pathogenesis. Pulmonary cystic fibrosis in adults does not always resemble the condition in children, and must be differentiated from other chronic interstitial diseases.\\n',\n",
       " 'As far as rabbit alveolar macrophages are concerned, the concentration of homozygous CF serum used in our experiments was even greater than the fourfold concentration which Biggar and associates state was required for normal phagocytosis.  Increasing dilutions of homozygous CF sera with either Hanks balanced salt solution or normal human serum, thus decreasing its concentration, increased the capacity of the rabbit alveolar macrophages to phagocytize and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Increasing concentrations had just the opposite effect.  Suspension of rabbit alveolar macrophages in human serum reduced their phagocytic activity, but activity was reduced more by human CF serum than by human normal serum.  This is not unexpected because high human serum concentrations are likely to be toxic to rabbit alveolar macrophages.  Because the inhibition of phagocytosis was absent when homozygous CF serum more than 24 hours old or previously heated or frozen was used and because of our observations that dilution increased macrophage phagocytic ability, we feel our data demonstrate the presence of a labile inhibitor rather than a deficiency.  Since it is well known that CF patients have normal or elevated concentrations of immunoglobulins including IgA in their sera and pulmonary secretions and respond to infection, and IgA has not been shown to be essential for alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we cannot agree that this inhibition is due to an IgA deficiency.  We also note that some of the sera used in the experiments of Biggar and associates were stored at -70 degrees C.  Perhaps this may account for the difference in results.\\n',\n",
       " 'We assayed the serum of a group of cystic fibrosis patients that were on oral arginine therapy and that of a group of cystic fibrosis patients that were not receiving this treatment for total arginine esterase activity.  The untreated cystic fibrosis patients have significantly lower serum arginine esterase activity than the normal controls, the cystic fibrosis carriers, and the cystic fibrosis patients receiving oral arginine therapy.  There is no significant difference between the arginine esterase activity of the normal controls and the cystic fibrosis carriers or the cystic fibrosis patients treated with arginine. -  We have recently observed differences in the arginine esterases in plasma of controls and patients by electrofusing on polyacrylamide gels. Six activity bands could be detected in plasma of controls, whereas only five could be detected in plasma of patients.  Our work on the deficiency of trypsin-like activity in mixed saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis has been reproduced by another laboratory. Coburn recently confirmed our work on deficiency of arginine esterase in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. At present, the deficiency of arginine esterase in cystic fibrosis is a working hypothesis to understand the basic defect. - The variations of pH and sodium chloride content that I employed had been tested by me in 6 patients both with and without a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and were found not to alter the level of arginine-esterase activity.  The major differences between the two studies resulted from the control subjects.  Dr. Rao neglects to mention the few other laboratories that were unable to confirm his findings.\\n',\n",

In each age group, the mean SRaw was lower for females than it was for males.  No control subject had an SRaw greater than 8 sec cm H2O.  A decrease in mean SRaw from 4.2 sec cm H2O for females 5 to 9 years of age to 3.5 sec cm H2O for those over 18 years of age paralleled sexual maturation, but similar changes were not observed in the males.  A direct correlation of SRaw with clinical observations was found in young patients with various degrees of pulmonary involvement because of cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ciliated nasal polyp epithelium from patients with allergic rhinitis and patients with cystic fibrosis was maintained in organ culture for 168 hours.  Explanted epithelium retained its morphologic characteristics and incorporated 35SO4 and 3H into blood group specific glycoproteins that were secreted into the medium throughout the culture period.  Labeled mucous glycoprotein was solubilized by reduction and alkylation, then purified by gel filtration chromatography.  Purified glycoprotein was further separated on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose columns into 3 blood group active fractions.  These fractions had similar amino acid compositions but differed in N-acetyl neuraminic acid and fucose content and in relative incorporation of 35SO4 and 3H-glucosamine.  Blood group glycoproteins from polyp epithelium of patients with allergic rhinitis and cystic fibrosis were indistinguishable in many respects.  However, the 35SO4 per 3H ratio of all 3 glycoprotein fractions from patients with cystic fibrosis exceeded that of the corresponding fractions from secretions of patients with allergic rhinitis.\\n',\n",
       " 'The pressure-volume behavior of the lung was studied in 24 patients with cystic fibrosis.  Isovolume flow-pressure relationships were measured in 7 of these patients, and a modification of the flow-volume test was evaluated for detection of flow reduction in a separate group of 63 patients.  Relative to results in a control group of 31 normal subjects, 13 of the 24 patients had grossly abnormal pressure-volume curves with excessive stiffness of the lung near maximum volume and loss of recoil at lower volume.  Closing volumes in these patients were often high enough to cause significant disturbances in gas exchange and the elevated closing volumes were quantitatively explained by the low values for elastic recoil.  The modified flow-volume test detected mild flow reduction in many patients who otherwise had normal pulmonary function tests. Loss of recoil per se did not account for the low maximum expiratory flows, since \"upstream\" resistances were high.  However, pressure-flow curves were effort-dependent at high lung volumes even in patients with severe airway obstruction, showing that time constants of emptying varied widely in these patients.  It was concluded that deterioration of lung function in cystic fibrosis involves more than airway obstruction and that the worsening gas trapping is explained by a progressive loss of lung elastic recoil.\\n',\n",

The enzyme was activated by treating the plasma with chloroform and ellagic acid in the manner described by Rao and associates (1).  No difference was found either between the arginine esterase activities of the patients with cystic fibrosis and the control subjects, or between the degrees of activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.  Thus, the findings of Rao and associates of a deficiency of arginine esterase activity in the plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis were not confirmed.\\n',\n",

Evidence for possible muscular involvement in cystic fibrosis patients is clinical (muscular weakness and wasting in many patients), biochemical (creatinuria on a creatine-poor diet, with reversal of this finding after ingestion of tocopherol esters, accompanied by a decrease in creatine in plasma and an increase in creatine in muscle), and pathological (focal lesions in skeletal muscle resembling nutritional muscular dystrophy, and ceroid pigment in smooth muscle).  Muscle strength was measured with a bulb ergograph in 45 patients with cystic fibrosis attending the clinics at the Babies' Hospital, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York.  In a double-blind study, in which half the cases received tocopherol orally, and the remainder placebo, no significant increase in muscle strength was found in those patients receiving tocopherol over a period of 6 months as compared to the placebo group.  Blood tocopherol levels in the treated group returned to normal.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The hypothesis that mist tent therapy decreases the viscosity of sputum by direct liquefaction of the sputum in the lower respiratory tract was tested in 6 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The first night all patients slept without the mist tent and the first morning sputum was collected for analysis.  The following 2 nights patients were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or ultrasonic nebulizer.  The early morning sputum was analysed for volume, viscosity, water content, and DNA content, an index of purulence.  There was no relation between sputum viscosity and DNA content, water content, or volume.  Furthermore, there was no consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated and the presence or absence of an 8-hour stay in the tent with either method of water nebulization.  These results therefore suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum viscosity or volume in patients with CF.  Above a sputum water content of 90%, further increases in water content do not influence viscosity.\\n',\n",

Normal meconium was shown to contain alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin and most samples contained low concentrations of albumin, and measurable amounts of a variety of other plasma proteins.

The diagnosis of coeliac disease is largely dependent upon the demonstration of histological changes in the small intestine, but jejunal biopsy may be distressing to a small child.  It is suggested that food protein antibody studies may be of value in the investigation of children with cystic fibrosis in whom gluten sensitivity is suspected.  In the following case the decision to perform a jejunal biopsy was made when these studies were positive. Food protein antibody to cereal antigens, wheat, oatmeal, and gluten, and to ruminant antigens, cow's milk, and calf serum were persistently detected in the patient's blood.  Jejunal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy with shortening, broadening, and branching of the villi.  There was a satisfactory clinical improvement after gluten restriction.\\n\",\n",

Factors complicating diagnosis and management include its low incidence, the diversity of aetiological factors found, and the severity of underlying or associated disease.  28 cases presenting since 1957 at Southmead General Hospital were reviewed.  Thirteen aetiological factors relating to mother or baby were found.  13 infants were premature, 10 had severe respiratory problems at birth.  Maternal hydramnios was present in 7.  6 babies had had exchange transfusion. The commonest findings were gangrenous volvulus and cystic fibrosis. Combined factors were often present.  The usual presentation is with bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass normal meconium.  4 cases had distended abdomens at birth.  Plain abdominal x-rays are of great diagnostic value.  Pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic but absent from early films.  Treatment is surgical.  Close liaison with the paediatrician who sees the baby first is essential.  In assessing results it is pointed out that many of these babies are small and/or suffering from serious conditions such as haemolytic disease, cystic fibrosis, or gangrenous volvulus.  8 cases were considered unfit for surgery.

Failure to obtain reproducibility was related to inadequate sweating by the subject and this was most likely to occur in the first week of life.  There was generally a clear distinction between healthy children and patients with cystic fibrosis.  The method was simple and reliable provided that the operator had had reasonable experience with the instrument.  One distinct advantage of the method compared with the use of filter paper was the speed with which results were obtained. The design of the instrument made the method completely safe and only a few patients noticed slight tingling during iontophoresis.

The social and emotional problems experienced by family members, particularly the patients and mothers, are reported on.  At all ages, socially embarrassing symptoms and awareness of being different create major problems for the patient.  The uncertainty of prognosis and doubts about the prospects of employment are specially relevant for the teenager. It is suggested that the patient be given ample opportunity, from early adolescence onward, to discuss all aspects of his disease, and that more appropriate provision should be made for the total care of adult patients.  Many problems, such as depression, feelings of isolation and the physical demands of constant treatment, which the parents of children with cystic fibrosis experience, are probably similar to those confronting parents of other chronically ill and handicapped children.  But special difficulties stem from the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis and from the knowledge of an eventually fatal outcome.  The roles of professional members of the medical team are touched on, particularly in relation to genetic counseling and the provision of practical and emotional support to parents.  Comments are made on the establishment of lay organisations.  The financial strain associated with obtaining regular medical attention was looked at, and suggestions are made for minimizing the economic problems of certain vulnerable families.\\n',\n",

       " 'Hereditary abnormalities of intestinal transport are rare conditions but are of disproportionate importance because of the information they give regarding the mechanisms of intestinal absorption in man. The main disability is usually diarrhoea, but there may be abnormalities from lack of absorption of an essential nutrient or occasionally from absorption of compounds in excess due to failure of a normal control mechanism.  These diseases are experiments of nature which cannot be exactly simulated in the laboratory animal, and thus may on occasions give information unobtainable from other sources.  Most often, however, they confirm that the mechanisms of absorption studied in detail in smaller mammals are probably applicable to man.  In some of these diseases there is an associated defect of transport in the proximal renal tubules as well as in the gut.  They furnish evidence, therefore, that transport processes are closely related in the gut and in the kidney, or at least that an important step in transport is identical at the two sites.  Such disorders include disorders of carbohydrate absorption, hereditary defects of amino acid absorption, hereditary defects in the absorption of fat, hereditary disorders of the intestinal absorption of electrolytes, and hereditary defects of vitamin B12 absorption.\\n',\n",

Sputum was from patients with either asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis and, macroscopically, mucoid, mucopurulent or purulent.  As in the viscosity plot over this shear rate range two Zones with a junctional region can be distinguished.  In Zone 1, over the lowest shear rates, elasticity increases slowly, changes little over a \"plateau\" region and then, in Zone 2, increases sharply.  In contrast to the viscosity plot, the plateau does not show nothing.  By 0.8 c/s some samples show decreasing elasticity. Although variance between samples is wide, there is no level of elasticity characteristic of each disease or of one macroscopic appearance.  Elasticity and viscosity are correlated, most significantly at the lowest shear rates.  Asthmatic and bronchiectatic sputa resemble each other in that this correlation is still significant at higher shear rates, cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitic sputum in that it is not.  Since in these last two mucous gland hypertrophy is present, it may be that the sputum has a higher mucus component.\\n',\n",

They were shown to depend markedly on the clinical state of the children particularly on the presence of pulmonary tract infectious processes.  These infections caused a rise in immunoglobulin concentration with predominance of IgM in C.F. children aged up to 3 yrs, and with predominance of IgG in older children.  Mean titer of isohemagglutinins in children with C.F. was higher than in healthy children.  Low titers of diphtherial and stapholococcal antibodies were found.  In the case of anti diphtheria antibodies, this can be attributed to the fact that these children are not regularly vaccinated owing to their poor clinical condition.  As to the low titer of antistaphylococcal antibodies this is a well known finding in the course of chronic staphylococcal infections of appropriate bacteriological tests in our C.F. children.

However, a qualitative difference was observed in the Ca2+-dependent ATPase, since the enzyme had relatively greater activity at lower calcium concentrations in the cystic preparations. This effect on the membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase is unlikely to represent a genetic defect in the enzyme itself but it may be connected with the mechanism of pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

Ten per cent of the CF patients had elevated or reduced serum IgG concentrations and there seems to be a transient low serum IgA concentration in the same number.  Serum IgM concentrations were normal in CF patients.  Normal levels of the three serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) were detected in the siblings and heterozygotes.  Serum IgE concentrations were elevated in 32% of patients with CF but normal concentrations were detected in heterozygotes and siblings.  Precipitating antibodies to various antigens and allergens were detected in the sputum of most patients with CF, but their sera contained lower or undetectable titres of these antibodies.  The precipitating antibodies in CF sputum to bacteria, to agar, to seminal fluid, to urine and to human serum may be related to a common antigenic determinant of the glycoproteins present in all these fluids.  The total protein concentration in the sputum of CF patients seemed to reflect the extent of lung damage. The third component (C3) of serum complement concentration was normal, or moderately elevated in all CF patients tested.  Serum transferrin concentrations were normal in CF patients but their prealbumin levels were depressed, suggesting marginal undernutrition.

A most simplistic statement would define asthma as a recurring form of dyspnea marked by wheezing breath sounds.  The incompleteness of this definition is apparent: asthma is really a symptom complex of labored wheezing breathing, characterized by hyperreactivity of the bronchi to various stimuli, resulting in generalized narrowing of the airways, variable in scope, and often reversible by sympathomimetics, theophylline derivatives, and corticosteroids.  A variety of conditions must be considered when studying the wheezing child.

A careful nasal examination is essential for the recognition of chronic sinusitis, the most common predecessor of chronic sinusitis. Allergic rhinitis is probably the second most common background of acute and then chronic sinusitis.  Chronic sinusitis in children with cystic fibrosis is a characteristic finding.  Sinusitis is common in cleft lip and cleft palate children.

In these studies alterations of the serum protein fractions were found, some of which were significantly correlated with the clinical and radiological severity of the disease.  In the present study, serum proteins determined by paper electrophoresis in 95 patients with CF have been studied and correlated with clinical and radiological findings.  The serum proteins and electrophoretic patterns if 95 patients with CF were followed for 1 to 6 years in each patient.  For CF patients as a whole, total serum protein was unchanged, whereas albumin and albumin/globulin ratio were decreased and all globulin fractions increased.  Total serum protein was increased in patients with severe pulmonary disease.  The changes in total serum protein and in all protein fractions were significantly correlated with clinical and radiological severity of the lung disease.  All terminal patients had severe changes.  Patients with complicating liver cirrhosis had electrophoretic patterns that did not differ from those of other CF patients.

The results show decreased excretion of hydrogen-ions and an increased excretion of bicarbonate.  Evidence is presented that due to reduced secretion of hydrogen-ions in the duct both the reabsorption of sodium and the secretion of potassium may be impaired.  Reduced flux of protons across the luminal membrane of epithelial cells is proposed as a general feature of exocrine gland defects.  It is then possible to describe both the cationic transport defect of the sweat gland duct and the anionic bicarbonate-secretory defect in one term.\\n',\n",

In contrast, the morbidity and mortality of diseases of genetic origin have been little affected. The rational use of cell culture as an investigative technique in inherited metabolic disease is rooted in the simple biologic truth that, since a full complement of chromosomes is present in all somatic cells, it should be possible to detect the specific biochemical consequences of gene activity in cultured fibroblasts unless, during the process of differentiation, genes are irreversibly inactivated.  The usefulness of tissue culture in investigating inherited metabolic disease does not rest with the biochemical identification of the primary defect.  The cells in culture provide a model system of the disease, which can be used to test the possible effectiveness of therapeutic agents.  Tissue culture techniques indicated that the cells derived from patients with cystic fibrosis showed metachromasia.  Although the isolation and characterization of cystic fibrosis from cystic fibrosis serum has not been accomplished, a number of properties have been described.\\n',\n",

No difference was observed in mean hemoglobin and serum iron levels and bone marrow non hemoglobin iron between patients receiving and those not receiving pancreatic enzymes.

Its occurrence in children of Afro-Americans is quite rare and exceedingly so in those of Oriental extraction.  Since cystic fibrosis is genetically determined as an autosomal recessive trait, and since the obligate heterozygote parent is entirely asymptomatic, the disease on its first occurrence in a given family can only be suspected by its manifestations in the patient himself.  At present there is no test available for the detection of cystic fibrosis which can be applied as a simple, practical screening test, such as is available for phenylketonuria.  Diagnostic tests are, therefore, used to confirm or refute the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis when suggestive symptoms arise or when a sibling or relative is known to have the disease.\\n',\n",

In the newborn infant the diagnosis of homozygote (PiZZ) deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin could be established in cord serum at the time of delivery.  Trypsin inhibitory capacity (TIC) and alpha1-antitrypsin (AT) in cord serum were in the range of adult homozygotes.  By means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis exclusively, the phenotypic alleles ZZ were demonstrable.  This excludes the possibility of materno-fetal transfer of alpha1-antitrypsin.  In infant amniotic fluid extremely low antiprotease-activity and substantially no alpha1-antitrypsin was found, whereas in normal samples the TIC is 3% to 6% of the cord serum values and the AT 1.2% to 4% of cord serum concentration.  Our data suggest that a major component of TIC and AT in normal amniotic fluid derive from the fetus.  In normal meconium we detected TIC and AT in concentrations increasing proportionally to the total protein content.  The inhibitory capacity of AT in meconium expressed in mg trypsin inhibited per mg alpha1-antitrypsin however is 80% less than serum alpha1-antitrypsin.  No correlation exists with the free tryptic activity of meconium.  The AT of an PiZZ infant is clearly diminished when referred to fresh weight, whereas meconia from three cystic fibrosis newborns screened by the BM test had extremely high concentrations.  Estimation of TIC and AT in meconium is regarded as a useful approach for screening on homozygote alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.  The exact diagnosis however can only be established by phenotyping the alleles.  In cystic fibrosis the high protein content of meconium is accompanied by increased alpha1-antitrypsin levels.\\n',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this communication is to discuss how the application of one methodology - the study of the cultured human cell - has added insight into understanding the genetic reasons for such disparate clinical phenotypes.  A mutant genotype not recognizable and/or understandable in vivo can often be recognized in vitro by studying the metabolism and morphological characteristics of the cultured cell.  Two syndromes will be used as illustrations of this principle - the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses and cystic fibrosis.  The patients described were selected to demonstrate how the use of cell culture adds insight into the diagnosis of human genetic disorders. The study of the cultured human cell has and will aid in advancing our ability to diagnose human genetic disorders.\\n',\n",
       " 'Admissions to hospital in the Republic of Ireland, in Scotland, and in England and Wales for coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis are compared.  Admissions to hospital in 1972 for coeliac disease in the Republic of Ireland - which does not yet have full returns of hospital admissions - was approximately three times greater than the number expected based upon the rates in England and Wales in 1969-71.  In Scotland the admission rates for coeliac disease were about twice the expected number based upon the English rates.  This contrasted with admissions for cystic fibrosis which were only slightly higher in Ireland and in Scotland than in England and Wales - evidence that the high admission rates for coeliac disease represent a genuinely high rate in the community.  Admission rates for coeliac disease were as high in the East and South of Ireland as in the West.  In Ireland, the potato, and not the wheaten bread, was the staple diet before the great famine of the 1840s.  In nineteenth-century Scotland, too, less wheaten bread was eaten than in England and Wales.  In the past, therefore, coeliac disease would not be as disadvantageous in Ireland, and to a less extent in Scotland, as in England and Wales.\\n',\n",
       " 'The cytoplasmic metachromasia phenomenon with Toluidine Blue 0 in cultured skin fibroblasts was studied in 12 parents of children with cystic fibrosis and in 12 controls.  Positive findings were recorded in 10 of the CF parents and in one of the controls.  The average culture time required for development of maximum metachromasia in positive cases was six weeks.  The possible significance of the ametachromatic CF patients in relation to the suggested genetic heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis is discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Forty-six deciduous teeth from 17 children with cystic fibrosis who had a recorded history of tetracycline therapy were sectioned vertically and horizontally.  Teeth in three representative staining categories (mild, moderate, and severe) were photographed under visible and ultraviolet illumination to determine the extent of tetracycline incorporation into tooth enamel and dentin. Tetracycline incorporation into enamel was minimal or nonexistent, whereas tetracycline incorporation into dentin was always observed. The severity of general surface discoloration was directly related to the proximity of the tetracycline incorporation to the dentinoenamel junction.  This was dependent on dosage, duration, and period of initiation of tetracycline therapy as it related to odontogenesis.  Critical periods to avoid tetracycline therapy and thereby to minimize potential tooth discoloration were determined.\\n',\n",
       " 'Screening an apparently healthy population for metabolic disorders raises many ethical problems.  It is necessary to differentiate clearly between screening programmes of a service nature and those which are really research projects.  Screening for phenylketonuria, histidinaemia, galactosaemia, cystic fibrosis, Tay-and Sachs disease are discussed.  These disorders demonstrate some of the advantages and undoubtedly difficult problems which screening presents.  It is essential that no one should lose sight of the fact that the aim of screening is to help the individual and the community.  The psychological aspects of screening are very important and continuing thought must be given to the fact that biochemical abnormalities do not necessarily equate with disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'The objective of this investigation was to further refine a technique developed to serve as a new test procedure for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas utilizing a more quantitative approach for measuring, in a standard fashion, the volume of secretion of the minor salivary glands of the lower labial mucosa, which can be collected over a fixed period of time.  It was also hoped that such standardization would facilitate the more accurate study of all aspects of study of minor salivary gland secretion collected in this fashion.  From the findings, it is obvious that less minor salivary gland secretion was collected from cystic fibrosis patients than from normal control subjects, using a capillary tube test.  This may be due, in part, to an increased viscosity of minor-salivary-gland saliva in cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, viscosity studies were beyond the scope of this investigation.  The results indicate that the relative differences between the volume of minor salivary secretion collected at a standard test site and that collected over the total lower labial mucosa are similar.  The volumetric differences in minor salivary secretion have again been found to be distinctive enough to suggest that studies be continued in this area to further refine a diagnostic test procedure for cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  At the present time, studies are in progress to measure the volume of minor salivary secretion at a standard test site employing an electronic technique. It is hoped that this approach may permit the elimination of viscosity as a variable.\\n',\n",

In this paper, such intracisternal inclusion bodies were induced or found in a variety of animals following chemical administrations, artificial hibernation and cold exposure, and also with cystic fibrosis.  These inclusion bodies are tentatively classified into 6 types based upon their morphological aspects.  The formation, fate and significance of these bodies are also discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Over the last 10 years, pyocin typing has been a useful tool for the epidemiological fingerprinting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The widely used \"scrape-and-streak\" method of Gillies and Govan, although simple to perform, has not been sensitive enough in differentiation of strains.  Use of additional indicator strains might correct this deficiency.  The \"growth-in-broth\" method of typing has shown promise; because it is easily automated, it may become the method of choice when very sensitive results are required.  The value of pyocin typing appears to be well established in the study of nosocomial infections; however, in some situations it may give misleading results.  Further studies are required for demonstration of the relative value and relationships of serological, pyocin, and bacteriophage typing.\\n',\n",
       " 'Study of the humoral antibody response of patients with cystic fibrosis to the heat-stable O (and possibly K) antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that these antibodies in significant titers do not lead to eradication of the microorganism from the respiratory tract.  In three out of six patients, antibodies directed against the strains isolated from both sputum and the lungs at autopsy were present in elevated titers.  The antibody response to P. aeruginosa is strikingly affected by the condition of the host and differs in patients with cystic fibrosis or with one or another kind of malignancy.\\n',\n",
       " 'Various techniques have been utilized for measurement of antibodies against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  In general, the results of such measurements tend to parallel each other, but the principal functional antibodies against Pseudomonas appear to be opsonins of the IgG and IgM immunoglobulin classes.  These antibodies are potentiated by the complement system, activated either through the \"classical\" or \"alternate\" pathways.  Susceptibility to fatal infection with Pseudomonas is associated with antibody deficiency, but this defect is usually correlated with other data regarding the state of the host, such as underlying disease, immunosuppressive therapy, and functional leukopenia.  Additional information is needed on the relative protective role of IgG and IgM antibodies, the affinity of such antibodies for viable bacteria, and the role of antibodies against nonlipopolysaccharide antigens, such as protein components of the cell wall and Pseudomonas exotoxins.\\n',\n",
       " 'A heptavalent lipopolysaccharide vaccine against Pseudomonas has been developed.  Clinical trials revealed a decreased incidence of sepsis and mortality due to Pseudomonas in vaccinated patients with burns.  If vaccinated, certain groups of immunosuppressed patients with cancer may also have a decreased incidence of death associated with Pseudomonas.  Trials of parenteral vaccination in patients with cystic fibrosis show little benefit.  Adverse reactions to this vaccine are frequent and often limit the dose given.\\n',\n",
       " 'We examined white cell cultures from 45 parents of CF patients (ie, compulsory heterozygotes) to confirm if possible the existence of an ametachromatic group (class III0 and the quantitate this class in relation to the numbers of heterozygotes showing vesicular cytoplasmic metachromasia (class I0 and generalized metachromasia (class II).  Leucocyte cultures from the 45 CF carriers were set up in parallel with similar cultures from 45 normal healthy controls. The results confirm the value of the Toluidine Blue O metachromasia phenomenon in white cell cultures as a method for heterozygote detection in cystic fibrosis and suggest that it may be justified to replace the tedious, expensive and time-consuming fibroblast technique with the much simpler and more rapid leukocyte culture procedure.  The simplicity and apparent reliability of the leukocyte culture procedure as outlined here should facilitate intrafamilial investigation and co-ordination of metachromasia class with other parameters such as sweat electrolytes, ciliary dyskinetic factor and clinical manifestations.  Such a study, if it revealed distinct and consistent phenotypic correlations, might furnish valuable additional evidence for genetic heterogeneity in cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

A plethora of abnormalities have been disclosed yet none can be accorded the pride of place as the primary inherited abnormality. It is nevertheless hoped that in the near future, as a result of collaboration and integration of highly specialized areas of research, meaningful and significant data can be obtained which will ultimately be of value not only in identifying heterozygotes with this condition but also in the handling and treatment of patients with this common and disabling inherited disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Suspensions of Proteus vulgaris were rapidly agglutinated by serum from cystic fibrosis patients.  Serum from obligate heterozygotes exhibited a mean agglutination time that was significantly less than that observed for 128 controls.  The agglutinating property was observed to be transmitted through several generations and through both maternal and paternal branches of the pedigrees.  Qualitative differences were noted, with CF sera inducing the formation of clumps that were two- to 10-fold larger than those observed in heterozygotes.  The serum factor responsible for P. vulgaris agglutination was heat sensitive, destroyed by pronase, and neutralized by anti-human whole serum.  The CF serum retained agglutinating activity following preincubation with anti-human IgG, IgA, B1E, and B1A/B1C.\\n',\n",
       " 'A strain of Staphylococcus aureus (no. FAR4) has been isolated from a patient at frequent intervals over 18 months.  This strain has previously been shown to lose resistance to several antibodies (Lacey et al., 1973); during the last 6 months further changes have occurred in it in vivo.  Lincomycin resistance appeared after the patient had been treated with clindamycin.  This was due to mutation to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin at a locus adjacent to that determining \"inducible\" resistance to erythromycin.  Both loci are probably carried by an extrachromosomal element.  Three types of variation in the PF plasmid were observed. Alteration in production of penicillinase from macroconstitutive to microconstitutive, was not associated with any detectable change in plasmid size.  This change gave the cell an advantage in vitro, because it was associated with a faster growth rate and probably also in vivo, because the microconstitutive variants were isolated in increasing numbers after flucloxacillin therapy had ceased. Complete loss of determinants for penicillinase production and for resistance to cadmium ions from the PF plasmid was associated with a decrease in plasmid size of about 4 x 10 6 daltons.  This change was also associated with increased growth rate in vitro.  Loss of resistance to fusidic acid from the PF plasmid was associated with a decrease in plasmid size of about 1 x 10 6 daltons.\\n',\n",

       " 'Staphylococcal empyema is not a rare occurrence in patients with cystic fibrosis, occurring in as many as 4.5 per cent of such patients in our recent experience.  In some patients, it may be the presenting illness in infancy.  Cystic fibrosis patients with empyema now constitute a significant percentage (approximately 3 to 7 per cent) of the total number of patients hospitalized with empyema. Since most of these empyemas occur in infancy and most are of staphylococcal origin, sweat tests should be done on all infants admitted with staphylococcal pneumonia with or without empyema, particularly when recovery with adequate treatment is unduly prolonged.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fecal fat and nitrogen excretion were determined in 20 patients, 12 to 17 years of age, with cystic fibrosis (CF); all had pancreatic deficiency.  Current clinical and nutritional status and growth achievement in relation to fecal nutrient loss, age at diagnosis, and adequacy of treatment were evaluated.  Steatorrhea and azotorrhea were present to a variable extent (at times massive) in all patients studied, but bore little relation to existing intestinal symptoms, state of nutrition, growth achieved, or age at diagnosis.  Many of the patients with better growth, nutrition, and prognostic scores had been diagnosed relatively late in life and presumably had not received adequate or optimal treatment.  Addition of pancreatic supplements resulted in significant, but not dramatic decreases in fecal losses of fat and nitrogen.  It was concluded that despite pancreatic deficiency most older patients with CF need little dietary restriction, although treatment should be individualized.  Growth failure and state of nutrition seem to be correlated more closely with the pulmonary state than with pancreatic deficiency.  For ultimate prognosis, natural variation in the severity of lung involvement is at least as important as early diagnosis and adequate or optimal treatment.\\n',\n",
       " 'The recent data suggest that we can no longer use mist tents or intermittent aerosol therapy for cystic fibrosis patients with the abandon previously employed.  We cannot accept such therapy as having been proved to be effective.  We formerly believed aerosols and mists could do little harm; we now know they can be harmful.  If such treatment is to be used, the patient should be closely monitored clinically and with sensitive pulmonary function tests such as maximum expiratory flow volume curves.  It is obvious that we have much more to learn, confirm or disprove with respect to the rationale for and benefits of mist and aerosol therapy.\\n',\n",

There was no peripheral edema or hypoproteinemia, although at necropsy there was evidence of biliary cirrhosis.  Although the sweat abnormality might have been due to as yet unknown factors, the temporal association with cloxacillin administration suggests a causative relationship, and it is tempting to speculate that the anomaly was produced in this instance by the substitution of the cloxacillin radical for the chloride ion in the sweat during the period of therapy.  In light of our findings it would be of interest to know whether the infant reported by MacLean and Tripp was receiving any drugs at the time of the initial sweat chloride estimations and whether sodium estimations were also performed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Pancreatic glucagon and insulin were determined in 10 children with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and in a control group following stimulation by an arginine infusion.  In controls the infusion of arginine induced a prompt threefold elevation in plasma pancreatic glucagon and about a sixfold increase in plasma immunoreactive insulin.  In patients with C.F. the average response of both hormones was considerably less, and the base-line concentrations for glucagon were lower.  The data support the hypothesis that in C.F. both alpha- and beta-cell function are affected as a result of the underlying process.\\n',\n",
       " 'The efficiency of delivery of an aerosol to 22 children with cystic fibrosis, aged 8 months to 17 years, was investigated with the use a standard ultrasonic nebulizer.  The study was designed to simulate clinical conditions as closely as possible.  Retention of the aerosol was monitored with a scintillation camera interfaced to a small digital computer.  The children also had ventilation studies with xenon-133, which allowed comparison of the distribution of aerosol with regional ventilation.  The aerosol was visualized within the lungs of all 22 patients.  Between 0.8 and 6.5 per cent of the initial activity was deposited in the lungs, representing an average of 0.27 ml. per therapy session or 0.0131 ml. per kilogram of body weight.  There was a positive correlation (r = 0.89; p < 0.01) between increasing age and greater pulmonary deposition of the aerosol.  There was decreased aerosol entry to regions which were poorly ventilated.  The efficiency of aerosol deposition is variable in children with cystic fibrosis, depending primarily on the age of the patient, whereas its distribution within their lungs is related to regional variations in the severity of the pulmonary disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'The recent interesting report on cystic fibrosis with edema and falsely negative sweat test prompted us to report a similar case. The previously reported similar cases and this one suggest that when cystic fibrosis is suspected in an edematous infant and the sweat chloride or sodium concentration is within the normal range, the test should be repeated after the edema has disappeared.\\n',\n",
       " 'Twelve patients with abdominal complaints had an operation that included incidental appendectomy.  They were later diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis.  Four groups of presenting signs and symptoms were right lower quadrant mass, chronic abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and hepatomegaly.  In all cases the symptoms precipitating operation were due to the underlying unrecognized condition: cystic fibrosis.  Review of the histology of the appendix revealed the classic changes of hypersecretion of the mucous glands to be present.  The appendix shares in the generalized intestinal mucous gland involvement peculiar to cystic fibrosis.  Awareness of this fact has not been widespread, perhaps because of the usual emphasis on the pulmonary and pancreatic aspects of the disease. Greater appreciation of the clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis and more liberal use of the sweat test could have diminished the number of exploratory celiotomies.  Recognition of the histoloc changes in the removed appendices can also suggest the proper diagnosis and lead to earlier institution of treatment with an improved prognosis.\\n',\n",

We wish to report the occurrence of meconium ileus in two full-term siblings with normal pancreatic function and no evidence of cystic fibrosis by history of physical findings, and with normal sweat electrolytes.  To our knowledge this is the first report of familial meconium ileus without associated cystic fibrosis of the pancreas or pancreatic insufficiency.\\n',\n",
       " \"Infants with cystic fibrosis occasionally may present with a symptom complex of anemia, hypoproteinemia, and edema.  Case reports of seven infants between the ages of 1 to 4 months who developed these abnormalities indicate that in several instances the children's condition was misdiagnosed as milk-sensitivity or milk-allergy. Furthermore, their case histories verify that their hypoalbuminemia and anemia is nutritional and is corrected when a readily absorbed diet with pancreatic-enzyme supplement is given.  A retrospective review of feeding histories of 100 infants with cystic fibrosis, as well as these case reports, indicate that affected children who are breast-fed or fed with soy-based formulas are more likely to develop the syndrome.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Since the report of an edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex in infants with cystic fibrosis, several articles have been published.  We have also participated in the care of identical male twins with this interesting symptom complex.  These twins offer two more examples of the edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex of infant cystic fibrosis.  In the presence of transsupplementation and the absence of hemolysis, the normal serum iron and increased peripheral and marrow iron values suggest that the anemia results from a defect at the level of hemoglobin synthesis, and that iron transport remains sufficient in the face of protein depletion. Possibly, a relative iron deficiency occurs after increased nutritional intake due to increased utilization.  Lee suggested that the hypoproteinemia is due to loss of protein in stools, but these twins suggest that the problem lies not with losses through urine or stool, but rather with failure in protein synthesis.  The possibility of hypoproteinemia secondary to liver dysfunction is attractive.  Although all liver function tests and biopsy findings were normal, this is often the case in patients with cystic fibrosis.  The anemia is associated with increased serum and marrow iron values, and is most likely due to a decrease in hemoglobin synthesis.  Routine cystic fibrosis therapy appears to be sufficient for clinical recovery for all components of the symptom complex.\\n',\n",
       " 'A 3-day-old infant, meconium stained at birth, presented with respiratory distress.  Hypoplastic left heart syndrome was diagnosed clinically and documented at autopsy.  Unsuspected cystic fibrosis was demonstrated by the histologic presence of severe focal biliary cirrhosis with spreading fibrosis in the liver; minimal lesions in the pancreas and intestines were compatible with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.  The abundant hepatic fibrosis is unusual in an infant of this age indicating its in utero origin.  This case is also unusual because of the fortuitous association of cystic fibrosis and a congenital cardiac malformation.\\n',\n",
       " 'Alterations in the pulmonary vascular bed were reviewed in the autopsy material from 35 patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and cor pulmonale.  Hypertrophy of the media or intimal proliferation of small muscular arteries and arterioles was noted in eight patients; intimal proliferation of the larger caliber arteries was seen in seven patients.  The unexpected change, however, was the presence of interstitial hyaline material in the media of the pulmonary artery or its major branches in one-third of the specimens.  The elastic fibers were distorted, but not disrupted, and the finding was unrelated to the presence or severity of other vascular changes.  Intimal deposits of the same material were also present in seven of the patients with intimal proliferation in major pulmonary arteries.  Identical medial lesions were found in the pulmonary arteries of seven of 35 children with pulmonary hypertension and in seven patients with other disorders.  Similar lesions in the media of the aorta were found in each group of patients.  The material was not Schiff-reactive, but had the histochemical characteristics of a connective tissue acid mucopolysaccharide.\\n',\n",

It has been our observation that children often find these preparations unpleasant and unpalatable.  Loose motions, nausea, and vomiting are quite common.

       " 'Dr. Conover and his colleagues reported no difference in the haemolytic activity of serum complement components C1-C9 of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) patients, obligate heterozygotes, and normal controls.  They also measured individual complement components by radial immunodiffusion and found a significant rise of C3 but no significant difference in C5 levels between these groups.  Using immunodiffusion kits from the same manufacturer and freshly obtained sera, we have observed quite different findings.  C5 was mildly elevated in 20 and more highly elevated in 25 of 56 C.F. patients, 2 to 29 years of age.  C5 was also elevated in 24 of 51 parents of C.F. patients, 15 showing mild and 9 higher elevations, while 4 of 24 controls showed only mild elevation.  No correlation was observed between serum-C5 levels, and the age, sex, clinical severity of disease (judged by Shwachman-Kulczyki scores), sputum bacterial colonisation, and mode of treatment of the C.F. patients. The elevation of C3 and C5 in a majority of patients with C.F. and obligate heterozygotes is very interesting and is suggestive of certain genetic defect(s) in the complement activation system in this autosomal recessive disorder.\\n',\n",

It seems that parents are well aware of this response, and repeating Professor Elliott's observation by soaking the hands of six infants with cystic fibrosis in hot water showed that very marked wrinkling was present by five minutes and often by two minutes.  This did not occur in control children of similar nutritional state except in a case of twins - one with cystic fibrosis, one without - where the unaffected child's fingers began to wrinkle slightly by five minutes.  The wrinkling does not appear to be associated with wasting due to malnutrition since it occurs equally in plump and in thin infants with cystic fibrosis, nor is it present in children with severe wasting and respiratory disease not due to cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",
       " 'An unsolved problem in human population genetics is the high frequency of the gene for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in Caucasians. Whereas the gene frequency is probably low enough in non-Caucasians to be maintained by recurring mutation, this is not the case in Caucasians, where the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 25. In order to establish a stable genetic polymorphism for a gene where the homozygous state is lethal, some degree of heterozygote advantage must exist, and it has been suggested that C.F. heterozygotes have a higher reproductive fitness than normal individuals.  It is not possible, of course, to know exactly how stable the C.F. polymorphism is, and one cannot exclude the possibility that some form of heterozygote advantage has existed at some time in the past and no longer exists today.  We should like to suggest a possible explanation which has much in common with the generally accepted explanation for the very high frequency of the sickle-cell gene in certain populations.  In the latter case, heterozygotes have an increased resistance to a particular type of malaria.  Patients with C.F. and heterozygous carriers have been found to have, in their serum, a substance (probably a protein) that agglutinates Proteus vulgaris.  Immunological cross-reactivity between certain strains of Proteus (e.g., OX 19) and Rickettsia prowazeki has long provided the basis of a serological test for typhus (Weil-Felix reaction).  Thus it is conceivable that the C.F. heterozygote might have an increased innate ability to counter infection by R. prowazeki.  Although typhus is known in many parts of the world, it seems to have been predominantly endemic and epidemic in the temperate regions inhabited by Caucasian peoples. Some areas where it is now endemic, such as South America, first experienced the disease after it had been introduced by Europeans. This would seem to be compatible with the observed higher C.F. gene frequency in Caucasians than in other groups.\\n',\n",

The range of normality varies in different climatic conditions, and in Aukland wrinkling does not appear in cool tap-water (18-22 C) under 3 minutes in normals.  Skin wrinkling on immersion appears to be age-related, but is difficult to detect reliably in the newborn. Prior washing of the hands, or immersion in sea-water (even the day before), accelerates skin wrinkling, as does warm weather.

       " 'In preliminary studies of short-term leukocyte cultures using Na2-35SO4 incorporation into cetyl-pyridinium-chloride (C.P.C.)-precipitable material (presumably glycosaminoglycans, G.A.G.), we have found significant variation among C.F. patients and their parents (obligate heterozygotes).  This biochemical heterogeneity is comparable to what has been reported in fibroblast cultures and serum.  The amount of Na2-35SO4 incorporated into G.A.G. material found in both the incubation medium and the cells from C.F. patients is significantly increased over normals.  A similar analysis between normals and heterozygotes shows no significant difference in Na2-35SO4 incorporation into G.A.G. material of the cells.  However, 4 out of 6 heterozygotes appeared to show a pattern of increased incorporation into material found in the incubation medium (indicated by a higher mean than the normal donors).  These results suggest yet another system to study the effects of the C.F. gene.  The incorporation of Na2-35SO4 into G.A.G. material of C.F. leukocyte cultures gives additional evidence for the genetic heterogeneity in this disorder.\\n',\n",
       " \"Freshly obtained sera were assayed from 14 C.F. young adult patients (age 18 - 33, 7 men and 7 women) and from 15 control patients with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis in whom C.F. had been ruled out.  In addition, the blood from 2 mothers (heterozygotes) of C.F. patients was assayed.  The mean C3 level in the C.F. men was slightly lower than that in the male controls, whereas the C.F. women had a significantly higher mean level of C3 than did the female controls.  The C3 level in the C.F. women was also significantly higher than that of the C.F. men (p < 0.01, t = 3.855 by the Student's t test).  The female controls had slightly higher C3 levels than did the male controls, but this difference was not significant.  Comparison of C3 levels from all of the C.F. subjects to the controls shows considerable overlap in values, especially in the men.  These studies suggest that an assay of serum-C3 does not effectively distinguish C.F. subjects from patients with other types of chronic lung disease.  However, the differences between C.F. women and C.F. men is interesting and deserves further attention.  Our data from C.F. young adults do not fully confirm those reported by Conover et al., but it is possible that the experimental effects of carboxypeptidase B observed by Conover might result from action of the enzyme on the C.F. factor of serum, although its identity most likely is not C3a.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Previous studies on cystic fibrosis (C.F.) have shown increased mucopolysaccharide synthesis in C.F. cells.  The uptake of 35S-heparin sulphonate into purified lymphocytes was examined after 3 days' culture in medium 199 supplemented with 20% autochthonous  plasma.  Fourteen C.F. homozygotes, seven siblings, and nine parents all showed significantly greater uptake (p < 0.001) of 35S-heparin than cultures from twenty-three normal controls.  There was partial overlap in heparin-uptake values between C.F. patients and their families.  This procedure thus differentiates C.F. families from the normal population, but does not differentiate C.F. homozygotes from heterozygotes.  It is hoped that either variations in culture methods or a combination of this procedure with other measurements of C.F., such as ciliary dyskinesis or cellular metachromasia, will permit unequivocal identification of C.F. carriers.\\n\",\n",

This physical sign is highly reliable irrespective of the degree of nutrition of the patient.  It is sometimes seen in infants with marasmus. Normal skin wrinkles eventually to exposure to water (except that from the Dead Sea).  It is possible that the disorder of salt flux in cystic fibrosis is connected with the apparent excessive hypertonic reactivity of the skin.  Three minutes and a bowl of water might provide a cheap screening test for this condition.\\n',\n",
       " 'In 1972 May, Herrick, and Thompson questioned the classical hypothesis of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and suggested that C.F. children are in fact abnormally susceptible fo any respiratory pathogen from birth.  It is perhaps a bit premature to change the classical hypothesis for the bacteriology of C.F.  Since the predominant flora of hospital nurseries is not now Staph. aureus but rather gram-negative bacteria, it may be that the initial exposure of C.F. patients is to an organism other than Staph. aureus.  In addition, other organisms are becoming as resistant to antibodies as Ps. aeruginosa, so other organisms could perhaps be present in terminal sputum flora - which agrees with our data.\\n',\n",
       " 'It has been claimed that the nitroblue tetrazolium (N.B.T.) test is of value in the surveillance of children with cystic fibrosis, a positive test giving evidence of active bacterial infection which may not be apparent clinically and not made evident by such investigations as the white-blood-cell count, sputum culture, and chest X-ray.  The test was therefore included in the routine assessment of patients attending this clinic.  Of the total 269 N.B.T. tests, 110 were positive.  In only 57 of these cases was there other evidence of infection; these 57 were treated with antibiotics.  The remaining 53 were left untreated.  Of these, 41 remained completely free of infection by standard criteria at subsequent review.  In 12 cases, however, the patient developed obvious infection before the next clinic visit.  It could be argued that in those cases the N.B.T. test had given early evidence of infection not otherwise apparent.  This is by no means certain, since the onset of infection could have been at any time during the four-week interval.  In our experience, the N.B.T. has been of little help in the management of cystic fibrosis.  There were in this series 27% false-negatives and at least 37% false-positives, some of which had very high counts.  It is possible, however, that in 12 (i.e., 4%) of the tests carried out, the N.B.T. gave early indication of infection not otherwise suspected.\\n',\n",
       " \"We wish to respond to the letter of Dr. Woods and Dr. di Sant'Agnese regarding their study on the reliability of the ciliary assays in cystic-fibrosis screening.  These investigators concluded that results from their study ruled out the possibility that reliable conclusions could be obtained from ciliary assays.  We feel that this conclusion is far from accurate, although it has never been the intention of any of our research groups to utilise ciliary preparations for massive heterozygote screening or prenatal diagnosis.  Ciliary assays have provided valuable scientific progress in cystic fibrosis research.  The existing assays are not suitable for massive screening for cystic fibrosis or for the clinical detection of cystic-fibrosis carriers; nevertheless, these techniques offer the most promising method to study, purify, and characterise a molecule or molecules directly or indirectly related to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",

This activity is heat-evoked in serum, heat-labile in urine. Heat-stable and heat-evoked factors were also found respectively in saliva and tears.  The serum and urine factors withstood freeze-thawing.  Activity of both factors was destroyed by pronase, and activity of the urine factor was destroyed by trypsin.  After incubation with alphaamylase the factor in urine induced production of a very aberrant type of secretion.\\n',\n",
       " \"We were interested in Professor Elliott's description of early skin wrinkling in children with cystic fibrosis.  Although this phenomenon may well be related to osmotic differences between skin and water, it has been observed that skin wrinkling (as seen on the finger pulp) is fully dependent on an intact peripheral nerve-supply.  This is a useful sign in peripheral nerve lesions and helpful in following recovery when the wrinkling returns. Furthermore, it was our impression that in normal individuals wrinkling was more apparent on the left hand than on the right-handed individuals.  However, in a preliminary study using fingerprint densities measured by photometry, no significant differences were found between the sides.\\n\",\n",

Our results show that this not true.  Marked wrinkling after immersion of the fingers in warm tap water for 5 minutes was observed in randomly selected children with a wide variety of conditions, including not only cystic fibrosis but also malnutrition and renal, heart, endocrine, collagen, and other diseases.  It was elicited even in apparently healthy individuals, both young and adult.\\n',\n",
       " \"The prevention of fetal malformations and abnormalities has long been the hope of obstetricians, paediatricians, and geneticists, but since the cause of most human malformations and of spontaneous gene and chromosome mutations is unknown, this must remain a dream for the present.  However, with the introduction of mid-trimester amniocentesis it is now possible to detect some abnormalities early enough for selective abortion of abnormal fetuses, though this should be considered a temporary expedient only.  The abnormalities which are amenable to this approach are the chromosome aberrations such as Down's syndrome, the neural-tube malformations including spina bifida cystica, and some recessively inherited and X-linked metabolic disorders.\\n\",\n",
       " 'We have reported that red-cell glutathione reductase (G.R.) activity is increased in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.) patients in comparison with age and sex matched controls.  We have also demonstrated that serum-G.R. activity is significantly greater in C.F. than in controls, obligate heterozygotes, and patients with a variety of respiratory and immunological diseases.  Moreover, serum-G.R. from C.F. patients and carriers responds differently from controls after storage or incubation with heparin.  We have now examined G.R. in white blood-cells (W.B.C.) of C.F. patients. The day after collection of samples mean W.B.C.-G.R. activity was significantly less in the C.F. group than in carriers and controls. No differences in G.R. activity between the groups was apparent after 4 and 6 days.  White-cell G.R. activity apparently is lower in C.F. patients than in controls.  We cannot rationalise this decrease with the increased activity found in C.F. red cells and serum.  Nevertheless, the differences between C.F. and controls are of greater interest than the apparent directional contradiction. The basis for quantatitive enzyme differences is very difficult to determine.  The simplest explanation is that the initial white-cell G.R. differences between C.F. patients on the one hand and controls and carriers on the other are secondary to some aspect of the disease or its treatment; but there is no evidence to support such a conclusion.  These results, which reflect altered behaviour of G.R. from C.F. patients, suggest to us that G.R. is involved in C.F.\\n',\n",
       " 'The water-binding capacity of a protein is minimal at its isoelectric point (pH 3.5 - 5 for the keratins making up the horny layers) and increases with increasing divergence from the isoelectric point.  It is for this reason that normal palmar skin wrinkles after moderate immersion in warm water, especially if it is soapy (pH 8 or more).  However, in patients with cystic fibrosis it is the increased salt content of the sweat rather than the pH difference which increases the water-binding capacity of the keratin, and is responsible for the wrinkling in these patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'At present it is extremely doubtful if mass-population screening for any inherited metabolic disease other than phenylketonuria should be established beyond the few pilot studies at present in progress.  For many diseases, although early detection is clearly desirable or the technical means of screening are available, even the establishment of pilot surveys is not yet indicated.  Instead, methods of screening more limited populations at risk for particular disorders within a nationally coordinated administrative structure should be established.  Those with experience of mass screening for more than one inherited metabolic disease must surely be convinced that in new programmes launched prematurely the harm caused by incomplete detection of cases or recognition of disorders whose management is uncertain or unavailable can far outweigh any benefits.\\n',\n",
       " 'In 1969 Danes and Bearn proposed that the metachromasia noted in short-term white-blood-cell cultures from both cystic fibrosis (C.F.) homozygotes and heterozygotes probably reflected uptake of heparin from the culture-medium by pinocytosis and not, as in the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses, stored mucopolysaccharides.  This hypothesis was recently confirmed by Robertson et al.  Using 35S-heparin they demonstrated an increased uptake of heparin in short-term C.F. white-blood-cell cultures which corresponded to the observations made on the basis of staining.  However, as mentioned in 1971 by Bafalluy et al., any white blood-cell in culture can be overloaded with heparin.  As the processes involved in endocytosis and exocytosis probably are inconstant within one cell and certainly in different cell types, standardisation of cytoplasmic retention of heparin may not be possible in order to eliminate the partial overlap between normals, C.F. homozygotes and obligatory heterozygotes observed by Robertson et al.  This report on 35S-heparin again raised the question of the significance of cellular mucopolysaccharides in cystic fibrosis.  The relevance of mucopolysaccharides in the C.F. cultured cell is still unclear. Between 1968 and 1970 the mucopolysaccharide content of the cultured fibroblast was reported as normal and variable.\\n',\n",
       " 'Presumptive evidence indicates that the substance responsible for the pathophysiologic conditions of cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complement component, C3a, also known as anaphylatoxin.  The known biochemical and physiological properties of C3a, together with the behavior of this purified substance when associated with IgG in our tracheal bioassay, compare favorably with those of molecular species which  we have separated from sera and cell cultures of CF homozygotes and heterozygotes.  Sera from normal healthy subjects, previously inactive by bioassay for ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF), were converted to a CDF positive state by incubation with epsilon-amino-caproic-acid (EACA).  EACA is a known inhibitor of the carboxypeptidase-B-like anaphylatoxin inactivator, and is the method of choice for accumulating anaphylatoxins in normal blood. Incubation of EACA-treated normal sera and two fresh CDF-positive CF sera with carboxypeptidase-B produced reversion in all instances to a CDF negative, normal state.  It is proposed that anaphylatoxin inactivator, a carboxypeptidase-B-like enzyme, is defective or deficientin cystic fibrosis and that this deficiency is the primary gene defect.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ascorbic acid, acting on its own, is found to exert a bacteriostatic action in vitro on 16 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa tested. This action, attributable to the oxidation of ascorbic acid, is dependent on individual strains and the inoculum size.  In combination with sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, Septrin, ampicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol or colistin sulphate, ascorbic acid acts synergistically on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro.  Experiments in mice with erythromycin-ascorbic acid combination show that the curvative dose 50 of ascorbic acid acting alone is 11.22 milligrammes per kilogram body weight.  This was significantly lowered (P =< 0.001) to 6.91 mg/kg if administered in combination with erythromycin (10 mg/kg).  In human patients with cystic fibrosis, by the combined administration of ascorbic acid sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim, Roche) the pseudomonas infection could be controlled, as the viable number of organisms significantly diminished during the therapy.\\n',\n",

Because of possible complications in the erythrocytes from CF patients, and since the activity observed in a cell homogenate may not express the situation in the intact cell, we have looked for differences in the binding of 3H-ouabain in cultured normal and CF human diploid fibroblasts.  We observed no appreciable differences in the number of ouabain-binding sites between normal and CF cell strains.  We were also unable to observe any differences in the kinetics of ouabain-binding between normal and CF fibroblasts in K+-free phosphate-buffered saline solution, and the results were essentially the same as those seen in HeLa cells.  We observed no alterations in the kinetics of binding of ouabain nor any alteration in the total number of binding sites.\\n',\n",
       " 'Using the technique of 3H-ouabain binding to isolate cells Quissell and Pitot concluded that the Na+-K+ ATPase functions normally in fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients.  However this finding may not be very relevant to the Na+ transport defect occurring in this genetic disease.  The Na+ transport abnormality in cystic fibrosis seems to be confined to exocrine glands.  It is unknown at present whether the defect resides in an active or passive transport step of the cation.  At least with isolated sweat gland tissue and erythrocytes from cystic fibrosis patients, Na+-K+ ATPase activity has been found to be normal.  However a decrease in the ethacrynic acid-sensitive efflux, a Na+ exchange mechanism, has been reported in cystic fibrosis erythrocytes.  These findings suggest that there is no fundamental abnormality in the Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme in the disease, but there may be a defect in an ethacrynic acid-sensitive transport step.  Therefore in order to obtain a better understanding of the cation transport defect one should measure the binding of labelled ethacrynic-acid rather than ouabain.\\n',\n",
       " 'The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) has, to date, not been elucidated.  Elliott reported that intravenous administration of soybean oil and lecithin to children suffering from CF caused their sweat sodium concentration to decrease towards normal values.  This prompted us to investigate the fatty acid spectra of the various serum lipid classes of children with CF.  We have found that affected children are deficient in essential fatty acids.  The data suggest another approach to the study of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis.  There is an apparent deficiency in essential fatty acids, and a marked reduction in serum vitamin E levels has also been reported in CF.  These conditions might be partially corrected by intravenous injection, or possibly feeding of, lipids containing essential fatty acids with concomitant administration of vitamin E.  The observed deficiency in essential fatty acids may be produced by a reduced ability to absorb these acids from the diet and this, in turn, may result in defects in membrane structure or stability.  Reduced levels of vitamin E in CF may reflect a reduced requirement for this vitamin because of the lower levels of essential fatty acids. It is also possible that the observed deficiency in serum levels of essential fatty acids may lead to less than normal production of prostaglandins.\\n',\n",

This assessment was then checked for validity by means of a social worker interview.  Implications for further research are discussed.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Nearly all agree that home therapy, which permits cystic fibrosis children to lead nearly normal lives, is desirable.  Between hospital visits, it's also essential for warding off the primary threats of CF: pulmonary insufficiency and cor pulmonale.  Treatment is palliative, focusing on supplying enzymes that the body can't secrete and, when the lungs are involved, clearing airway obstructions.  The first step in therapy is starting the child on supplemental enzymes, which will enable him to absorb fat and protein.  Usually we encourage a normal diet.  If X-rays, pulmonary function tests, or clinical observation shows lung involvement, we initiate pulmonary therapy and teach parents how to perform it at home.  Postural drainage is continued indefinitely, even if the lungs clear.  If the child shows clinical signs of infection, we instruct the parents to increase the number of active mist and postural drainage treatments and to administer oral antibiotics in high doses.  Above all, we instruct the parents of CF children to treat them as normally as possible.\\n\",\n",

Today cystic fibrosis is known to be one of the commonest genetic disorders affecting children in Britain. The children who actually develop cystic fibrosis have inherited the disease from both parents, who are carriers but are unaffected by the disease themselves.  Being thick and sticky, instead of thin and slimy as it normally is, the mucus of the cystic fibrosis case tends to block the passages instead of clearing them.  The main problem is in the lungs.

       " 'Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are fats in which the chain length is six to twelve carbon atoms.  This is in contrast to the more usual dietary sources of fats, long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which contain more than 14 carbon atoms in their atomic chain.  The differences in chemical structure between LCT and MCT are important because they are related to major differences in the characteristics of absorption and metabolism of these two classes of lipids.  These physiological differences between LCT and MCT have led to the use of MCT in various disorders where malabsorption of LCT occurs but where MCT can be absorbed because they bypass several of the steps necessary for the absorption of long chain fats.  These include pancreatic disease, chronic liver disease, disorders of the biliary tract and diseases of the small intestinal epithelium and lymphatic vessels.  The comments which follow are a brief summary of the therapeutic place of MCT in children with malabsorption.  This will be followed by some remarks about the potential value of MCT in countries like Indonesia where the commonest cause of chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption in children is malnutrition and chronic and repeated gastrointestinal infections and infestations and where MCT has not been used widely.\\n',\n",
       " \"Diarrhea can be defined as excess loss of water and electrolytes in feces, but what is an excess?  To the physician, fecal losses may be excessive when they cause the patient to be ill; to a parent a stool pattern that differs from that of a neighbor's infant or even a single watery stool may be too much.  New knowledge of normal gut function and the pathologic processes that may afflict the child's alimentary tract has improved one capability to diagnose and manage certain specific diseases that cause diarrhea.  Although of great interest to academicians, many of these diseases are extraordinarily rare and in most practices there is a substantial and perplexing pool of poopers in whom no specific disease can be found. Fortunately, patients in this latter group are rarely seriously ill. This article attempts to help the practitioner understand, diagnose and treat children with specific diseases known to cause chronic diarrhea.

Treatment is geared at eradicating the Staphylococcus aureus from the lung and preventing reinfection.  Gram-negative organisms, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are treated when they become pathogenic.  Other conditions such as atopia of the respiratory tract or gastrointestinal system may be detrimental to the patient's cystic fibrosis condition and must be controlled.  Pancreatic insufficiency requires adequate enzyme replacement therapy to prevent steatorrhea and azotorrhea.  If fatty acids play a role in membrane oxygen transport then their abnormal composition in cystic fibrosis may require specific changes in the type of fat intake.  Salt depletion should be looked for and corrected.  A screening test for cystic fibrosis is needed, preferably one done on a small blood specimen.\\n\",\n",

       " \"The retrograde perfusion assay of Magos for the sodium reabsorption inhibitory effect in sweat and mixed saliva from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) was modified by (1) using the second parotid gland of the rat as a control, (2) carefully controlling the quantity of saliva perfused into the rat parotid gland so that the ratio of milliliters perfused to gram dry gland weight fell between 1.8 and 2.8, and (3) reporting the inhibitory effect as percentage of inhibition of the rate of sodium reabsorption (RNa) in the perfused gland calculated from the difference between the RNa's in the two glands.  Using this modified assay we were able to confirm that significant differences exist in the percentage of inhibition of RNa caused by CF and normal mixed saliva (47.0 plus or minus 24.8 and 18.0 plus or minus 8.3, mean plus or minus SD).  In addition, similar significant differences in the percentage of inhibition of RNa by submandibular gland secretions (39.7 plus or minus 13.5 and 16.0 plus or minus 11.8), sublingual gland secretions (39.5 plus or minus 6.0 and 19.7 plus or minus 14.3), and submucosal gland secretions (34.0 plus or minus 11.7 and 21.7 plus or minus 12.7) between CF and normal subjects were observed.  However, parotid gland secretions from CF subjects showed no increased inhibitory effect (12.5 plus or minus 7.9 and 12.5 plus or minus 6.6).  These findings demonstrate that the sodium reabsorption inhibitory effect is produced by the secretions from some but not all salivary glands of patients with CF.\\n\",\n",

       " 'A calcium-precipitable protein (CaPP), previously shown to cause turbidity of submaxilliary saliva (SMS) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), was purified from normal and CF-SMS by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, gel filtration, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  This protein has a molecular weight of 12,000.  It contains large numbers of serine, glycine, and glutamic acid residues, 0.85% phosphorus as phosphate monoester, and small amounts of carbohydrate.  Precipitation (aggregation) of CaPP occurs at basic pH values in the presence of ionic calcium and is enhanced by increasing calcium concentration, CaPP concentration, or pH. Aggregated CaPP binds calcium in molar quantities equal to the number of phosphate prosthetic groups.  Alkaline phosphatase removes all phosphate from CaPP and eliminates calcium-induced precipitation.  Studies of CaPP from CF saliva have demonstrated no electrophoretic or compositional differences from normal CaPP. Higher than normal pH values or elevated CaPP concentrations are not present in SMS of patients with CF and do not contribute to the formation of turbid SMS.  Aggregation and precipitation of CaPP in saliva of patients with CF seems to be induced primarily by elevated levels of calcium in saliva.  This precipitation may be entirely, or in part, responsible for focal obstruction of submaxillary gland ducts in patients with CF.  However, little or no CaPP is secreted in the lower gastrointestinal or tracheobronchial tracts. Therefore, CaPP does not play a more general role in the obstructive processes which characterize CF.\\n',\n",
       " 'ATPase activity and monovalent cation transport were examined in erythrocytes (RBC) of subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The RBC membrane (Ca2+)ATPase activity of homozygous patients and obligate heterozygotes was indistinguishable from that of normal control subjects.  This was true similarly for total, ouabain-sensitive, and ouabain-insensitive (Na+-K+)ATPase.  Total, ouabain-sensitive, and ouabain-insensitive 24Na+ transport were normal in CF cells. Ouabain-induced Na+ accumulation was similar in CF and normal RBC. Measurements of K+ transport in CF RBC were, likewise, normal.  We conclude that intrinsic ATPase and monovalent transport functions are normal in CF RBC.  We were unable to confirm several abnormalities in these cells reported previously.  The CF RBC is not helpful in defining a transport abnormality in that entity.  These studies document normal intrinsic transport function in RBC of patients with CF.  There have been reports of an abnormal serum factor in patients with CF.  This factor might be involved in the production of a transport defect in CF.  Further studies are indicated to determine whether CF plasma contains a factor capable of altering membrane transport functions of normal RBC.\\n',\n",
       " 'Arginine esterase activity in chloroform-ellagic acid-treated plasma from 11 patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) and 12 age-matched control subjects has been resolved into its component fractions by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and electrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels.  The activity can be resolved into two fractions by chromatography, one of which is inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) and the other of which is not inhibited by STI.  In plasma of CF patients, the fraction of activity inhibited by STI is reduced to approximately 30% of the corresponding fraction in control plasma.  In contrast, the fraction of activity resistant to inhibition by STI did not show any significant quantitative differences between control and CF plasma samples.  Analysis of plasma samples by electrofocusing on 5% polyacrylamide gels in the range of pH 5.0-8.0 and subsequent staining for arginine esterase activity showed qualitative differences between control and CF plasma samples.  Six activity bands could be detected in control samples, whereas five bands were detected in CF samples.  Eight samples had one type of band missing, two had another type of band missing, and one had yet another type of band missing.  All of these bands were restricted to a narrow pH zone in the center of the gel. These data are consistent with and extend our earlier reports of differences in arginine esterase activity between plasma samples of CF patients and control subjects.  The demonstration of the absence of a single band of arginine esterase activity is consistent with the absence of a specific arginine esterase isoenzyme in patients with CF.  The deficiency of arginine esterase in patients with cystic fibrosis may account for the presence of \"factors\" in saliva, plasma, and fibroblasts of these patients and consequently for the clinical manifestations of the disease.\\n',\n",

Cells from normal volunteers and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined during exponential growth by incubation with L-(methyl-14C)methionine and (3H)uridine. The ratio of 14C to 3H counts per minute in isolated RNA serves as a measure of the extent of methylation and was found to be similar in normal and CF fibroblasts for tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA. Hydrolyzed samples of (14C)-methyl-labeled RNA species were analyzed by two dimensional chromatography and autoradiography.  The methylated base and nucleoside compositions of tRNA and rRNA agree well with data for HeLa cells and other eurkaryote cells such as those from yeast, mouse, and chicken.  RNA methylation patterns in CF fibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed in normal cells for 4 S, 18 S, and 28 S RNA.  There is no evidence that RNA species from patients with cystic fibrosis are deficient in any methylated components.  Methylation of RNA by tissue-cultured cells from cystic fibrosis is qualitatively and quantitatively normal and will not prove to be a useful marker for identification of carriers of cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

Fifteen CF patients and 24 controls were studied.  Flow rates at 50% and 25% vital capacity (VC) were calculated from the air and helium-mixture MEFV curves and were compared to give flow ratios at these lung volumes.  At 50% VC, the helium/air flow ratios were similar in CF patients and normal subjects.  At 25% VC, the flow ratio was significantly lower (p <  0.05) in the CF patients.  The air and helium MEFV curves were superimposed and the point where the curves crossed (point of identical flow, PIF) was determined and expressed in % VC.  For the CF patients, the mean PIF was 18% and for the controls, 5% (p < .001).  Nine of the 15 CF patients had PIF values greater than 2 standard deviations (SD) from the normal mean.  None of the following tests were abnormal in more than three patients: FEV1/FVC, MMEF, RV/TLC, Vmax 50% TLC (TLC/sec), and Vmax 25% VC (TLC/sec). Arterial oxygen tensions were below 86 mm Hg in four patients. Closing volumes by the 100% helium bolus technique were normal in all patients.

In these hospitalized patients, the use of a butterfly scalp vein needle attached to a plastic tubing sealed by a rubber cap (\"Heparin Lock\") offers many advantages.  This report relates our experience with this method.  The use of an indwelling intravenous infusion set for the home administration of potent antibiotics has been quite successful in the therapy of the chronic bronchopulmonary infection associated with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'The authors of the recent article which failed to show a significant difference between sweat calcium concentrations of CF patients and control subjects, suggest that the findings refute our hyperpermeability hypothesis.  They found sweat Ca of 0.32 to 1.67 mEq/liter in 26 control subjects and 0.42 to 2.03 mEq/liter in 16 CF patients.  With these tremendous ranges many more subjects would be required to prove or disprove a difference.  A difference undetectable in a moderate number of subjects is probably not of pathophysiologic significance if the Ca really varies unpredictably.  Sweat Ca, however, is generally believed to vary with the rate of sweating, being much higher at lower rates, and measurements made at comparable rates might well show significant differences.  The authors did attempt to control rate, but in a very inappropriate manner.  They measured no constant rate, but took the average rate during the 30 minutes immediately after iontophoresis.  This gives little information concerning the rate at which the sweat was actually produced.\\n',\n",
       " 'The diagnosis, management and prognosis of 17 infants with cystic fibrosis  (CF) and severe respiratory disease were reviewed for the period 1968 to 1972.  The clinical course of these infants was characterized by a bronchiolitis-like syndrome with failure to thrive and malnutrition.  Arterial blood gases demonstrated marked hypoxemia (mean PaO2, 36.5 mm Hg).  Tracheal cultures showed a predominance of gram-negative microorganisms with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli predominating.  Corticosteroids were used in all patients.  Despite vigorous therapy including antibiotics there was a 60% mortality. A delay in the diagnosis of CF from the onset if respiratory symptoms with a mean of six weeks was considered an important factor affecting survival.  This data supports the need for developing a reliable screen test for CF at birth.\\n',\n",
       " 'Liver-spleen scans on 254 children were reviewed retrospectively with regard to accuracy and yield of examination.  The scan predicted abnormality correctly 95% of the time and normality correctly 86% of the time.  Pitfalls in interpretation include the nonspecificity of abnormalities present on the scan, confusion of extrinsic with intrinsic defects, and normal anatomical variations with pathology.  The technetium-99m-sulfur colloid scan was found to be most helpful in diagnosing splenic abnormalities, in working up abdominal masses, and in evaluating tumor patients with a baseline scan.  It was found least useful in patients with fever of unknown origin, abdominal pain, diffuse liver disease, and most inflammatory conditions.  Liver abscesses were not found in febrile, otherwise healthy children.  The iodine-131-rose bengal liver scan was found to be useful to differentiate potentially curable lesions (e.g., choledochal cysts) from those not surgically treatable.\\n',\n",
       " 'Amylase isoenzyme patterns were evaluated in serum, urine, and duodenal fluid from 19 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and normal subjects.  Two thirds of the CF patients with absent pancreatic enzymes lacked a serum pancreatic isoamylase band, while the remainder had a markedly diminished pancreatic band when compared to the salivary isoamylase.  In normal sera the pancreatic band is equal to or greater than the salivary band.  In all patients with absent enzymes the diagnosis of abnormal pancreatic function could have been made by evaluation of serum isoamylase patterns thereby avoiding duodenal intubation or collection of 72-hour stools for proteolytic enzyme activities.  The patients with normal pancreatic enzyme activities had normal serum zymograms.  No CF patient had a low total serum amylase concentration.  Total duodenal fluid amylase levels may be misleading in the evaluation of pancreatic function since the amylase may be of salivary origin.  The advantages of this isoamylase method include (1) simplicity and noninvasiveness, requiring only a small blood sample; (2) specificity for pancreatic function; and (3) independence of pancreatic enzyme medication.\\n',\n",
       " 'Gastric mucosal biopsies from eight new untreated patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and two normal subjects were studied by quantitative techniques of electron microscopy (EM) to determine whether presecreted gastric mucus was more compact (viscid) than normal.  Analysis of variance techniques show no differences between means of all groups studied.  These observations suggest that mucus may not be viscid prior to secretion.  Electron microscopy of gastric mucus does not appear to be of diagnostic value in CF.\\n',\n",

Bacteriodes sp. and some streptococci are the only major omissions from its spectrum.  MIC of sensitive strains is usually less than or equal to 2 microg/ml although Pseudomonas may require greater than or equal to 4 microg/ml.  The therapeutic range aimed for is 2-12 microg/ml in serum and peak levels are measured 1 hr after intramuscular and 20 min after intravenous injection.  Most workers regard a level of 12 microg/ml as potentially toxic and try to avoid exceeding it.\\n',\n",

The role of the dietitian is to work as a member of the medical team. Paediatric dietetics require rather more detailed advice and help for the parents, particularly when the diet involves calculation or restriction of specific nutrients.

       " 'This paper analyzes the cell cycle of cystic fibrosis-derived fibroblasts and statistically demonstrates their failure to support a normal population doubling time in vitro and indicates that this is due largely to a failure of the cystic fibrosis-derived cells to enter the cell cycle in normal numbers.  We have no explanation for the significant difference in the behavior of these cells from patients with cystic fibrosis vis-a-vis either normal or disease control fibroblasts, save to conclude that it proceeds from an intrinsic property of the cells themselves.\\n',\n",
       " \"Twenty-five children aged 8 months to 17 years were studied to determine the usefulness of computer-assisted ventilation-perfusion (V-P) scanning in analysis of regional pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis.  Ventilation and perfusion scintiphotographs were compared with the patients' radiographs.  Regional fractional exchanges of air and relative regional V-P ratios were obtained.  Whole-lung air-exchange was significantly correlated with standard pulmonary function tests and radiograph scores.  Ventilation-perfusion ratio gradients were reversed in pats with predominantly upper zone disease, and regional V-P ratios were uneven in distribution. Quantitative assessment of regional ventilation and perfusion is a useful technique for assessing severity of pulmonary disease in children with cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Tobramycin treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13 children with cystic fibrosis was evaluated.  Initially the patients received the recommended dose of 125 mg/m2/24 hours; the dose was then increased to 250 mg/m2/24 hours (approximately 10 mg/kg/24 hours).  This higher dosage was administered intramuscularly to 9 patients.  Eight of these received additional therapy with an aerosol containing tobramycin. With this therapy it was possible to eradicate Ps. aeruginosa from the respiratory tract in 5 of the patients.  After discontinuing therapy Ps. aeruginosa re-occurred in all patients within one month. All patients showed a clinical improvement in relation to therapy. No toxic or allergic side effects were observed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Thirty-five patients with cystic fibrosis (aged 11 months to 13.5 years) have been investigated with regard to respiratory symptoms, respiratory tract pathogens, serum immunoglobulins and serum precipitins.  Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest pathogen being supplanted in advanced disease by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The patients who had no respiratory infection had levels of IgG significantly lower than normal children of comparable ages.  In children with severe respiratory infection the immunoglobulins were raised and precipitins to the predominant respiratory organism were present.  These findings differ from the prevalent view that patients with cystic fibrosis have a normal response to infection and that the common infecting organism is Staphylococcus aureus.\\n',\n",
       " 'To compare the in vitro susceptibility of mucoid and nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa to gentamicin, 144 isolates of both mucoid and nonmucoid P aeruginosa were cultured from throat swab and sputum specimens from 29 patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis. Mucoid forms of P aeruginosa from throat swab cultures were all susceptible to gentamicin, whereas only 85.5% of the mucoid strains from sputum cultures were susceptible.  Nonmucoid strains from throat swab and sputum cultures were 85.1% and 77.8% susceptible, respectively.  Since the differences in susceptibility between the four groups of organisms were not significant (P < 0.05), it was concluded that these data show no real differences in susceptibility to gentamicin between the mucoid and nonmucoid strains.\\n',\n",
       " 'The purpose of the present work was to study the type of inheritance involved in mucoviscidosis.  Analysis of the genetic relations in mucoviscidosis performed on 26 families bears witness to a monomeric autosomal mechanism of transmission of the character.  In contrast to other recessive diseases, parental consanguinity plays a secondary role in mucoviscidosis, which apparently is explained by the wide distribution of the mucoviscidosis gene among the population.  The observations described may be utilized in medicogenetic consultations given to members of those families where there are children suffering from mucoviscidosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'It has been suggested that the development of goiter and hypothyroidism in patients receiving chronic iodide therapy indicates that they have underlying thyroid disease.  In 1971, Dolan and Gibson, in a retrospective study, reviewed the records of children with cystic fibrosis receiving chronic expectorant therapy with iodide and reported that approximately 85 percent had goiter and 15 percent suggestive clinical findings of hypothyroidism.  This study, together with the fact that the thyroid, like lung and pancreas, is of endodermal origin raised the possibility that patients with cystic fibrosis might have an underlying defect in thyroid function.  As thyroid function in patients with cystic fibrosis has not been evaluated in a systematic fashion, the present study was undertaken. In it, we have evaluated basal thyroid function in a large group of patients with cystic fibrosis and have, in addition, observed the effects of chronic iodide administration.  The present study strongly suggests that there often occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis some derangement in thyroid hormone economy.  The frequency with which iodides increased serum thyrotropin, decreased serum thyroxine concentration, and induced goiter, with or without hypothyroidism, in patients with cystic fibrosis, points strongly to the presence of an intrinsic abnormality of the thyroid in this disease.  The nature of such abnormality remains unclear.\\n',\n",

       " \"The author has attempted to evaluate some of the methodology currently in use or suggested for the routine determination of vitamin A in blood and tissues.  Special consideration is given to extraneous factors which can cause erroneous results in fluorometric analyses.  A review of the older and current literature on the distribution of vitamin A in tissues is presented.  Special consideration is given to the uptake of vitamin A by the liver and its storage in hepatocytes and Kupffer's cell and in subcellular organelles.  Data on the concentration of vitamin A in the liver of victims of accidental death and the effect of diseases of several etiologies are presented.  The mechanism by which liver stores of retinyl esters are mobilized and released to the plasma remains obscure.  Considerable information has been gained recently on the mechanism by which retinol is transported in blood.  Studies leading to the isolation and characterization of retinol transport proteins are summarized.  The metabolism of retinol binding protein in health and in disease, especially in cystic fibrosis, is discussed. Finally, some factors of importance to the interpretation of plasma levels in terms of vitamin A are reviewed.  Special attention is given to the effect on plasma levels of retinol and the retinol transport proteins of periods of rapid growth (correlations with age) and the influence of dietary adequacy on the distribution of plasma levels of the vitamin.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The pulmonary macrophages collected with bronchial mucus from patients with cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases were investigated histochemically for acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosaminidase activity, and also for mucopolysaccharide content.  In macrophages from patients with cystic fibrosis decreased beta-glucuronidase activity was observed, together with large cytoplasmic vacuoles suggesting storage of partially digested material.  It thus seems very likely that apart from the increased synthesis of mucopolysaccharides described in cystic fibrosis by several authors, the degradation of mucosubstances produced can be impaired.\\n',\n",

The patient's condition may be characterized by one or all of the following: chronic pulmonary disease, pancreatic enzyme deficiency and abnormally high sweat electrolytes.  Hence, each patient is treated on an individual basis. Parents tied to a rigid regime imposed by the disease must have help; volunteers are needed to support and assist them at home and at school.  Cystic Fibrosis still needs a lot of help, and knowledge and understanding on the part of the nursing profession helps a great deal.\\n\",\n",

       " 'The electrical potential difference (PD) across the rectal wall was measured in 26 patients with cystic fibrosis of pancreas (CFP) and in 18 healthy subjects. The PDs obtained in normal children were identical to those previously obtained in normal adults. A significantly greater dispersion of the values was observed in CFP. When the patients were divided into groups according to metachromasia in fibroblast cultures, the mean PD was increased only in the ametachromatic group. True enough, this observation suggests a difference between various forms of CFP, distinguished by metachromasia, and thus is a further indication of the heterogeneity of the disease. The greater abnormalities in metachromasia negative patients may, however, be due solely to the fact that these patients are more severely affected by the disease. The urinary excretion of tetrahydroaldosterone in patients was within the ranges obtained in controls, which excludes the possibility of secondary hyperaldosteronism as the source of increased PD. No evidence was provided in favour of a basic defect in the intestinal transport of Na+ or Cl minus, but K+ concentrations in faecal fluids of patients were significantly lower than in controls. The equilibrium concentration of K+ could be accounted for by simple passive diffusion, suggesting that the epithelium behaved inertly with respect to this ion in CFP.\\n',\n",
       " 'By measuring potential difference between rectal mucosa and perianal skin using a reference electrode placed on the forearm, we demonstrated an altered potential difference in cystic children compared with control adults and normal children.  We suggested this might be due to an alteration in the rectal mucosa potential or altered skin potential, or both, in cystic fibrosis.  We measured skin and rectal charges directly by connecting our reference electrode to the blood stream through an intravenous line.  Using this technique we showed that the cystic fibrosis patients (C.F.) have an abnormal perianal skin potential difference compared with readings we obtained in normal children.  There was little difference in the transmural rectal potential difference between our cystic patients and previously reported values in normal adults. Thus the recent paper confirms our findings of normal polarity of the rectal mucosa surface and the increased skin polarisation in cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fifty cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, of whom 9 had multilobular cirrhosis, were observed regularly for a period of 3 years and various liver function tests, indicating cytolysis, cholestasis and cellular insufficiency were performed. Immunoglobulin and prothrombin were assayed. In 9 patients with cirrhosis, the tests were generally abnormal. Two distinct biochemical patterns of cirrhosis were distinguished, one clearly cholestatic and the other of a more cellular type. The distinction was made on the basis of the IgA : Transferrin ratio and of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase levels. In the non-cirrhotic patients, a temporary increase of cytolysis and cholestasis was observed in 50% of the cases.\\n',\n",
       " 'A clinical study of the albumin content in meconium was performed on two categories of newborn infants: a screening series of 8,830 infants and a high-risk group for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) of 70 infants. A single radial immunodiffusion technique and test strips were used. Three CF infants were detected in the screening series (1:3,000) and 16 in the high-risk group. The diagnostic accuracy for CF was fairly good. The specificity was 99.8% for the immunodiffusion technique and 99.2% for test strips. A high concentration of albumin in meconium was found not only in CF but also in preterm babies and infants with gastrointestinal disturbances, such as atresias, malaena neonatorum and malabsorption syndromes. The sensitivity was 90% for the immunodiffusion technique and 78% for the test strip. False-negative results were probably due to proteolytic activity and might be avoided if the samples are stored at a low temperature before analysis. CF screening of all meconiums by the use of test strips followed by analysis of positive tests by the immunodiffusion technique is suggested.\\n',\n",
       " 'The simultaneously occurring mucoid (M) and non-mucoid (NM) variants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently observed in cultures from the respiratory tract of chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients have been studied. M cultures in vitro were unstable and easily dissociated NM colonies. In a large proportion of the cases, M and NM variants occurring simultaneously in cultures from one and the same clinical specimen were of the same pyocine type, phage type, and serogroup. In some remaining cases there were small differences between the M and NM variants such that identity between the variants from one and the same specimen was possible, although not definite. The NM dissociants from M strains were of the same type as the M variant. The possible role of cross-infection and the interaction of bacteria and host response factors continuously tending to select the unstable M variant in vivo are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'The relative prevalence of mucoid strains compared with non-mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been investigated in all routine bacteriological specimens received in a department of clinical microbiology during 1973. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 1054 of the specimens (5.7 per cent) representing 53 patients with cystic fibrosis (551 isolates) and 169 patients with other diseases (503 isolates). The relative prevalence of mucoid strains was significantly higher in specimens from patients with cystic fibrosis (80 per cent) than in specimens from patients with other diseases (3 per cent). Considering patients without cystic fibrosis, the relative prevalence of mucoid strains was low in specimens from all anatomical regions, and no special preference of these strains for the respiratory tract could be demonstrated in these patients, in contrast to the situation in patients with cystic fibrosis. Alternation between mucoid strains and non-mucoid strains in subsequent specimens was observed in 33 of the patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'The occurrence of antibodies against antigens prepared from strains representing 13 O groups of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against a polyvalent Ps. aeruginosa antigen (St-Ag) has been investigated in sera from 100 patients. By means of fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel it was found that the humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa resulting in precipitating antibodies will be detected by St-Ag as well as by any other of the antigen samples investigated. Six of the sera contained group-specific antibodies which were revealed by only one of the antigen samples used and not by St-Ag. These six sera were further studied by means of various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic methods using St-Ag as well as antigens prepared from the infecting Ps. aeruginosa strain in the patient concerned. In all six sera, only one extra precipitin could be detected using antigens prepared from the homologous strain instead of St-Ag. This extra precipitin corresponded presumably to group-specific O-antigens not included in St-Ag. In sera from patients, these group-specific antibodies were always accompanied by antibodies against antigens common to all strains of Ps. aeruginosa.\\n',\n",
       " 'During the recent decade, 1651 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from 111 patients with cystic fibrosis have been tested for antibiotic sensitivity and half of the isolates have been phage typed. All the patients were followed in one clinic and the policy of antibiotic treatment was consistent during this period. The results show a dynamic situation where \"epidemic\" phage types during recent years have been gradually replaced by other types and, during the same period, the prevalence of strains resistant to more than one antibiotic decreased. Multiresistant strains including strains resistant to methicillin were infrequent in these patients. From 23 per cent of the patients, the same strains were repeatedly isolated for more than 1 year despite an apparently successful chemotherapy. Recently isolated strains were found to produce cellbound as well as extracellular protein A. Ninety-one per cent of the strains produced extracellular lipase and only 8 per cent were resistant to mercury chloride. Eighty-one per cent of the patients produced precipitating antibodies against S. aureus as judged by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The investigated properties of S. aureus were not significantly correlated with the occurrence of precipitating antibodies against these bacteria. The possible significance of protein A in the pathology of the respiratory tract infection is discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'During recent years, more and more data have been accumulated implicating early malnutrition in subsequent small stature and behavioral abnormalities.  These studies can be divided into two large categories: one dealing with cellular and biochemical changes at a tissue level and one dealing with functional changes within the nervous system as measured by changes in various modes of behavior. This chapter will attempt to review the studies in both of these broad categories, which have led to the present concept that malnutrition during the growing period will permanently retard growth, resulting in a stunted individual, and markedly retard psychologic development, resulting in an individual with permanently altered behaviors.  We shall first consider the normal cellular and biochemical development of the central nervous system; second, we shall examine how malnutrition alters these cellular and biochemical processes; and finally, we shall review the evidence that implicates early malnutrition with alterations in later behavior and ability to learn.\\n',\n",

Patients with CFP maintained weight approximately 1 standard deviation below the mean until 8 years, after which there was a progressive decline in growth rate compared to normal. A complete dietary supplement consisting of a beef serum hydrolysate, a glucose polymer, and medium-chain triglycerides was given to 15 patients for a year.

Synovial fluid was analyzed in one patient and the synovium underwent biopsy in another. These studies excluded other causes of arthritis but did not contribute any new information on the nature of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Radiological examination of long bones confirmed the diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in all three patients.

       " 'Duke Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health have analyzed the maximum achieved heights and weights of 60 persons with CF over 20 years old.  Both parameters were markedly skewed toward the lower percentile bands.  No significant differences were found among patients whose condition was diagnosed early in life, in those with more severe pulmonary or gastrointestinal impairment, or among those in whom pancreatic enzyme and/or nutritional supplementation had been employed.  Nutritional supplementation has yet to be proven a significant long-term influence on the morbidity or mortality of CF. - Lober reported data on 60 persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) over 20 years of age, while our population of 63 individuals contained only three who were over 15 years old.  The median age of death in patients with CF is 12 years.  It is not realistic to compare patients who have survived to adulthood with a younger group.  He did not state the type of nutritional supplementation that was of no significance among his patients.  Our experience with nutritional supplements other than the amino acid-glucose polymer mixture has been equally poor.  Our data on growth rates were similar to those of Lober in that both heights and weights were skewed toward the lower end, and height was less affected than weight.  Increased rates of linear growth were observed in eight of 13 children under 12 years of age at the time the dietary supplement was begun.  Patients who continue to take the nutritional supplement have not shown further deterioration in pulmonary status.\\n',\n",

When seen in the older child, it is termed \"meconium ileus equivalent.\" We studied a case in which nonsurgical resolution of the obstruction was obtained with N- acetylcysteine enemas and pancreatic replacement enzymes given orally and by enema. The pathogenesis of this disorder and the basis for the treatment are described.

       " 'The respiratory flora of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently includes Aspergillus, and 30% of their serum samples have been observed to contain precipitating antibody to this fungus. Serum from 61 CF patients, 60 healthy persons, and three patients with CF and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis was studied, using a quantitative assay for antibody to A fumigatus. Although CF patients had significantly higher levels of Aspergillus antibody, some antibody was found in all serum samples from normal individuals. Binding was immunologically specific for A fumigatus. Serum IgE levels and dermal reactivity to Aspergillus were similar in both CF and normal subjects. Increased levels of Aspergillus antibody in CF patients probably reflect pulmonary colonization, which only rarely causes infection or sensitization.\\n',\n",

Of the 34 patients, 32 had an excellent serum hemagglutinating (HA) antibody response to immunization. In comparison to the patients with cystic fibrosis, the patients with leukemia had a smaller HA antibody response, which lasted a shorter period of time, and also}i experienced greater toxicity from the vaccine. The mixing of adrenal corticosteroids with vaccine greatly decreased side reactions among the patients with leukemia without significantly inhibiting antibody production. Previous antineoplastic chemotherapy had little influence on antibody response in patients with leukemia, with the exception of methortrexate. Vaccinated patients with leukemia had 1 Pseudomonas infection of 14 bacterial or fungal infections, whereas 2 pseudomonas infections of 5 bacterial or fungal infections occurred in a control group of 20 patients with acute leukemia. Of the 12 patients with cystic fibrosis, 4 had a Pseudomonas infection after vaccination.\\n',\n",

Diagnosis is mainly accomplished with an analysis of sweat for sodium and chloride ions.  CF is transmitted as a Mendelian recessive trait.  It is a generalized dysfunction of the endocrine glands.  The abnormalities, seemingly unrelated, appear as loss of electrolytes through the sweat and salivary glands and as unusually thick, sticky mucus secretions that obstruct and damage the patient's pancreas, lungs, gallbladder, intestines, and liver.  The objective of pulmonary therapy are to decrease viscosity of the pulmonary secretions and to improve and maintain pulmonary hygiene.

       " 'The characteristic increased salinity of sweat and other abnormalities of exocrine secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suggest the possibility of a disturbed functioning of the plasma membrane in this disease. Several lines of evidence indicate that fibroblasts express the presence of the CF genotype. Therefore these cells were used in an in vitro study directed at determining whether the manifestations of CF might be related to an alteration of one or more of the protein components of the plasma membrane. In order to evaluate the synthesis of these components, growing fibrosblasts from patients with CF and normal subjects were briefly exposed to either 14C- or 3-H-leucine. Their plasma membranes were then isolated and subjected to analysis in a nondetergent acrylamide gel system. Coelectrophoresis of differentially labeled preparations revealed the absence of a detectable abnormality in the synthetic rates of any of the more than 30 resolved protein species.\\n',\n",

The resulting values were compared with the alveolar- arterial PO2 difference, arterial PCO2, and standard measurements of lung volume, flow, and diffusing capacity. The arterial-alveolar PN2 difference was nearly one half of the PO2 difference, both early in the disease and at a more advanced stage. Analysis taking into account the O2 dissociation curve and the possibility that alveolar temperature is higher than sublingual temperature suggested that all of the PO2 difference could be explained in terms of ventilation- perfusion imbalance in gas-filled units of the lung. Reduction of fractional CO uptake with increasing PN2 difference suggested that the decrease in diffusing capacity in cystic fibrosis may be explained by ventilation-perfusion inequality. A significant relationship between arterial PCO2 and the PN2 difference supported the view that ventilation-perfusion inequality is the cause of CO2 retention when present. The PN2 and PO2 differences were abnormal before the standard tests of lung volume and flow, but in general, the correlation was excellent. Because the PN2 difference was not superior to the PO2 difference in detecting early disease, and because the technical problems in its measurement are considerable, it is not recommended as a routine measurement.\\n',\n",
       " 'The results of open thoractomy and pleurectomy or pleural abrasion for 17 episodes of pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis were compared with the results of observation, closed thoracostomy, and closed thoracostomy with sclerosing agents. Open thoracotomy had the advantage of insuring prompt resolution of the pneumothorax. A small incision minimized postoperative morbidity. The average hospital stay was 15 days after open thoracotomy and 19 days after closed thoracostomy, with or without sclerosing agents. Complications of all treatments were infrequent. A limited symptomatic recurrence was observed in 2 of 17 pneumothoraces successfully treated with open thoracotomy. Recurrence also occurred in 1 of 8 treated with observation, 3 of 9 treated with closed thoracostomy, and 1 of 14 treated with closed thoracostomy and sclerosing agents. A loss of vital capacity was usually noted 4 to 18 months after resolution, regardless of treatment. Forty per cent of patients in both operative and nonoperative groups survived 3 years. In our experience, open thoracotomy can be used safely for treatment of unresolved or recurrent pneumothorax and warrants further evaluation as a primary therapy for pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Normal children as well as those with asthma and cystic fibrosis were studied to assess the contribution of lung zones emptying at different rates to the curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow- volume curve. Lung volumes, maximal expiratory flow-volume curves breathing air and then breathing a helium-oxygen mixture, and single- breath nitrogen washouts were measured. Forced expiratory maneuvers from lung volumes near functional residual capacity were performed to produce transients of flow exceeding maximal flow defined by the full flow-volume curve. Normal children and those with asthma and mild cystic fibrosis had small or no transients. Those with severe cystic fibrosis had large transients as well as increased phase I on the nitrogen washout curves. These large transients were associated with increased curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve and smaller than normal flow response breathing helium. In severe cystic fibrosis, the large transients suggest sequential emptying of fast and slow spaces, which influences the shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve. The fast space could be due to compression of an enlarged anatomic dead space. Any time constant inequality between parenchymal units present in asthma and mild cystic fibrosis does not appear to contribute significantly to the shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve.\\n',\n",
       " 'Tracheal mucous velocity was measured by observing the motion of teflon discs across the tracheal mucosa through a fiberoptic bronchoscope. The average rate of movement in 14 adult patients with cystic fibrosis was 2.6 mm per min plus or minus 3.3 SD, compared with 20.1 mm per min plus or minus 6.3 in 20 normal subjects of the same age (P less than 0.001). This failure of mucociliary transport may play a role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis. Administration of a beta-adrenergic agent, terbutaline, increased the average mucous velocity in the patients with cystic fibrosis (to 5.5 mm per min plus or minus 3.6 SD, P less than 0.001) but not in control subjects. This observation has potential therapeutic significance.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mucociliary clearance data obtained by our group in relatively healthy cystic fibrosis subjects was not affected by cough.  The majority of subjects mentioned in the original article did not cough during the study and indeed were chosen because they were relatively healthy at the time.  It was possible to study them over fairly long periods without interference from cough and thus the relatively normal clearance times demonstrated were presumably due to mucociliary transport.  Reference was made to nasal mucociliary clearance studies in patients with cystic fibrosis and normal subjects which indicated that clearance was similar in both groups until mild inflammation of the nasal mucosa was produced.  We would like to point out that the work was performed in our Laboratory, since no reference was given in the discussion.\\n',\n",
       " 'The large number of congenital metabolic disorders makes a complete discussion of the biochemical problems, hazards, pharmacologic implications, and anesthetic recommendations for each impossible. This review is confined to discussion of certain aspects of several genetically acquired diseases of metabolism which the anaesthesiologist may be called upon to manage in the pediatric patient.  Every genetic metabolic disease is the result of a specific enzyme defect (or defects) in function or in amount.  In this review, diseases in which defects are known (e.g., homocystinuria), suspected (e.g., myotonia congenita), and unknown (e.g., cystic fibrosis) are discussed.  Therapeutic approaches to genetic metabolic disease include: supplying the missing product; preventing substrate accumulation; preventing alternate product synthesis; enzyme induction; enzyme replacement; increasing deficient function with cofactor administration; and compensatory therapy.  Obviously, the ideal way to treat the consequences of a genetic disease is to normalize the patient biochemically.  For diseases where the pathophysiology is clear, this goal is approachable; for conditions where the pathophysiology is unknown, only compensatory therapy is possible.\\n',\n",

There is weak evidence for linkage of cystic fibrosis to PGM3, but none for linkage to HL-A. No new suggestive linkages appeared.\\n',\n",
       " 'Young adults with cystic fibrosis have lower blood pressures than control subjects of similar age and sex. The low blood pressure may be related to the excessive loss of salt in the sweat of these patients.

       " 'Despite the availability of specific antibiotics, Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria still cause troublesome infections in patients with a variety of illnesses: extensive thermal injury, leukopenia from antineoplastic chemotherapy and other forms of immunosuppressive treatment, chronic pulmonary disease such as cystic fibrosis, or intravenous narcotic use. The use of antibiotics has improved the prognosis of pseudomonas infections considerably. However, patients with marginal or defective host immunity may need more extensive therapy to master the infection. By evaluating additional modalities of treatment such as granulocyte replacement, improved usage of antibiotics, and active (prophylaxis) or passive antibody administration, the optimal combination may be found.\\n',\n",
       " 'A phenomenon associated with the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the presence of a serum factor that stops or discoordinates ciliary beating.  This effect has been demonstrated by exposing freshwater mussel or oyster gill cilia, or rabbit tracheal cilia, to sera from homozygous or heterozygous cystic fibrosis subjects.  Assay reproducibility is unsatisfactory, however, and the mechanism of the effect is not understood.  Nor do we know why there may be considerable differences between the activity of tested heterozygotes and of homozygotes.  Because the ciliary assay is capricious, there is a need to understand how ciliary beating is disturbed or stopped. Since microtubules are important in the mechanism of ciliary motion, they could conceivably show alterations during the response to inhibitory substances.  There has been no ultrastructural study, however, of the effects of ciliary inhibition on the axonemal components.  Therefore, this study was designed to examine ciliary structure during the different stages of ciliary inhibition.  Rapid microtubular disappearance and reappearance occurs in the terminal cilia of the freshwater mussel Unio when exposure to CF serum causes a shock-stop reaction, and return to water allows resumption of normal ciliary beating.  In contrast, a slow-stop reaction causes distortion of cilia, asynchronous beating, and ejection of cells from the distal gill filament, but ciliary axonemal structure is preserved.  Slow-stopped cilia do not resume their beating in water. Saliva from reserpine-treated rats causes ciliary inhibition similar to that induced by CF serum.\\n',\n",
       " 'Primary peritonitis, rarely diagnosed preoperatively, is an uncommon disease accounting for 2.1% of all pediatric abdominal emergencies. It is often associated with urinary or hepatic pathology, the former the source of the infecting organism in the majority of cases, and presents with characteristic symptoms depending upon whether it occurs in infancy or childhood. The symptoms and signs which allow for a positive prospective diagnosis are illustrated by comparing this disease to those entities with which it is most often confused, e.g. diffuse peritonitis of other etiologies, and include a short duration of symptoms, associated urinary tract infection and an absence of free air on abdominal roentgenograms. In the past, gram positive organisms were the most common infecting agent; however, in this series gram negative bacteria accounted for 69% or the organisms. Antibiotics with a gram negative spectrum and exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy are the hallmarks of therapy, the latter replaced by abdominal tap only in the patient who satisfies the criteria for primary peritonitis and in whom an associated disease makes the risk of surgery prohibitive.\\n',\n",
       " 'The recent proliferation of genetic knowledge has been accompanied by speculation about its uses in the pursuit of both medical and social goals, as well as by fear and concern about possible misuses.  These speculations have appeared in the proceedings of numerous symposia and in many books and papers.  A review of this literature reveals that the nonmedical participants in this debate were preoccupied with those aims of genetics that might benefit (or threaten) society, while the physicians were concerned with the accomplishment of standard medical missions in which social aims figure only incidentally.  These missions are diagnosis, management, and prevention of disease.  The specific uses of genetic knowledge most frequently mentioned were advances in the taxonomy of disease that lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment of individual patients and their relatives, genetic counseling, and genetic screening.  The latter two, particularly screening, are preventive and represent the interface between medical genetics, especially population genetics, and society.  This review focuses on developments in genetic screening, defined as the search in a population, generally for medical reasons, for individuals possessing particular genotypes.\\n',\n",

       " 'Previous reports have indicated that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency have a raised faecal bile acid output.  In this study, 18 out of 29 CF patients and 2 out of the 4 non-CF patients with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency had raised faecal bile acid levels.  In the CF patients no correlation was found between faecal bile acid and faecal fat excretion, but an inverse relation was shown between faecal bile acid values and age. Those CF patients with overt liver disease tended to have the lowest faecal bile acid values.  Duodenal spiration in 5 CF patients and in one non-CF patient with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency (Shwachman-Diamond syndrome), produced very small fluid volumes. Duodenal fluid mean total bile acid concentrations were within normal limits.  Estimation of serum bile acids in these 6 patients showed that 3 patients had raised serum bile acid values.  It is suggested that excessive faecal bile acid loss may produce a contraction of the bile acid pool, and lead eventually to a reduction of intraduodenal bile acid concentrations.  Measures which curtail faecal bile acid loss may have a particular significance in the management of CF.\\n',\n",
       " 'It has always seemed to me that the use of the Exercise Lability Index (ELI) distorts results and may be misleading because a falsely high value for lability is obtained when the PEF at rest is low.  It is incorrect to compare percentage values from such patients with percentage values from those with figures at rest which are near to normal.  The Jones Liability Index avoids this distortion.  I do not suggest that a proportion of CF patients do not have abnormal lability but would maintain that the ELI introduces inaccuracy which may blur the distinction between CF and other respiratory conditions and may lead to the postulation of problems concerning lability in CF which do not necessarily exist.  Failure to use a bronchodilator agent to reinforce brief exercise may also cause distortion but in the opposite direction.\\n',\n",

Sweat tests have improved, pancreatic achylia was relieved, and the child at present remains entirely well. Correction of the essential fatty acid deficiency found in cystic fibrosis may prevent some of the manifestations of the disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have read with interest the report by Elliott and Robinson concerning the apparent beneficial effects of intravenous fat infusions in a child with cystic fibrosis.  We question whether the increase in essential fatty acids brought about by soya oil can account for the favourable course of the disease in this patient. Our own observations confirm that essential fatty acids levels are often below normal in cystic fibrosis, but they do not correlate with the clinical condition of the patient.  It seems unlikely that minor degrees of essential fatty acid deficiency would impair prostaglandin synthesis, or give rise to the usual clinical features of cystic fibrosis. - Our own more recent research in platelet aggregation, prostaglandin, and cyclic nucleotide production, makes us aware that simple EFA deficiency per se cannot be the origin of the symptoms of CF.  The possibility that some other agent in the infusion mixture (which, for example, contains about 12% tocopherol) may be a contributing factor, is also under investigation.  This does not, however, invalidate a possible therapeutic effect of EFA in the disease, and in particular, a partial correlation of a possible disorder of prostaglandin synthesis.\\n',\n",
       " \"Early insulin response to rapid intravenous injection of glucose was studied in 7 cases of cystic fibrosis aged 8 months to 9 1/2 years. Plasma insulin was measured with a radioimmunological method. Blood glucose values were determined and the glucose disappearance rate (kG) calculated. In all children except the youngest one the early insulin response values were low compared with normal children. The kG-values were normal and correlated neither to the duration of clinical symptoms, nor to the patients' actual clinical condition measured by means of the Shwachman score. The explanation of the decreased insulin response is probably the progressive fibrosis of the pancreas. This may also explain the reported increased incidence of diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis. Comparison is made with the condition in pancreatic fibrosis in rabbits, produced through duct ligation.\\n\",\n",

Positive skin tests were found in 56% of patients and 19% of relatives, but the prevalence of atopy in CF patients bore no relationship to its prevalence in their relatives. Increased 0ronchial lability, mainly due to bronchoconstriction, was present in 54% of patients and 27% of relatives. The results showed that increased prevalence of bronchial lability, but not atopy, is found in first-degree relatives of CF children, and that the abnormal lability and atopy found in CF children does not indicate a familial allergic background.\\n',\n",

Growth velocity and general health were assessed over a period of a full year for each child.  Patients who were only mildly affected by the disease showed improvement in stool frequency and growth rate when the diet represented the major part of their nutritional intake.  Patients who were severely affected showed no improvement in growth, general clinical status, or frequency of respiratory infections.\\n',\n",

More revealing evidence comes from the longterm survival studies done by Professor Warren Warwick, of the University of Minnesota.  The introduction of antibiotics have allowed the children to live loner, but 3/4 were dead by aged 10 years.  Physiotherapy given after infections prolonged lives so that half were still alive at 10 years - but still faced a relentless death rate.  Prophylactic - daily - physiotherapy produced a doubling of survival at 20 years from under 30% to over 60%.  I do not deny for a moment that daily physiotherapy with inhalations is a great strain on the family, but it is not as great as the strain of watching the slow and relentless decline of the child which, with racking cough and persistent dyspnoea, is anything but peaceful.\\n',\n",
       " 'A small polypeptide within the molecular weight range of 6,000 to 11,000 was found in immunoglobulin fractions from sera of cystic fibrosis homozygotes and heterozygotes.  This factor appears to be responsible for interfering with ciliary activity in oyster gills. Since it can be dissociated from IgG without reductive cleavage it must be bound in a non-covalent manner.  After its dissociation the IgG fractions from cystic fibrosis sera no longer inhibited ciliary activity.  This finding explains the differences previously observed in the molecular weights of the ciliary inhibitor synthesized by cultured cells and that of sera from cystic fibrosis genotypes.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have recently proposed a classification of the disorders of sexual development based upon the presumed site of action of the abnormal gene during embryogenesis.  These disorders, which may be either genetic or nongenetic in nature, are the result of disturbances in the physiology of sexual differentiation during embryogenesis.  The purpose of this review is to summarize the current physiologic concepts of normal sexual differentiation, to review the known hereditary disorders of sexual development, and to consider briefly the implications that these mutations have for the understanding of normal sexual differentiation.  The translation of genetic sex into phenotypic sex is a complex process.  Since some 19 hereditary, single-gene determined disorders of sexual development are currently recognized that involve loci on both the autosomes and the X chromosome, it can be inferred that at a minimum 19 genes and hence 19 discrete biochemical steps are involved in this process.  At least 10 mutations result in male pseudohermaphroditism, whereas only 2 mutations are known to cause female pseudohermaphroditism.  The predominance of male type of mutation is the result of the fact that the formation of the male phenotype is actively induced by the secretions of the fetal testis whereas the formation of the female phenotype does not require secretion from the fetal ovary.  The end result of these mutations that involve the formation and action of testosterone can be similar, and it requires anatomic, endocrinologic, and genetic study of individual patients to identify the mutant genes involved.  Undoubtedly, many more as yet unidentified genes must participate in sexual differentiation.  The identification of these genes will depend on the continued delineation of new simply inherited clinical syndromes.  Any fundamental understanding of the programming of events in phenotypic differentiation will require not only the identification of the genes involved but the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which each of these genes is expressed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Professor R. K. Chandra and others suggest that estimation of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) might help in detecting carriers in families at risk for cystic fibrosis.  Observers in the U.K. have been unable to confirm these findings, whereas Dr. J. A. Smith of New York supports them.  Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in the technique of estimating serum AFP.  if a small number of families is analysed the proportion of affected individuals may differ from the expected. By chance some families may have all normal children whereas some may have all affected children.  For example, nowadays, since families tend to be small, the appearance of an autosomal recessive condition is often sporadic with only one affected person in the family.  This could well apply to cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

By counterimmunoelectrophoresis we were unable to detect an increased serum concentration of AFP in any of the cystic fibrosis patients or their relatives.  In addition, the results from the radioimmunoassay method showed that all of the cystic fibrosis patients and their relatives had normal concentrations of AFP in their serum. - Using a double antibody radioimmunoassay we found the mean serum AFP for seven children with cystic fibrosis to be little different from that of controls, while all seven values fell within the normal range for this series. - In seven patients considered to have cystic fibrosis on the basis of a sweat chloride level above 65 mmol/l the mean serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP level was 1825 (range 130 - 2360) microg/l. The corresponding level in the patients was 433 (range 80 - 1055) microg/l.  Drug therapy given to these patients may have a subtle hepatoxic influence, thereby causing a rise in AFP levels.  The severity of the disease does not influence the degree of elevation. There is a corresponding rise in carcinoembryonic antigen levels also, but the latter is related to the degree of tissue damage and results from the sero-cross-reactivity between mucus-producing respiratory mucosa and fetal tissues.\\n',\n",

Considerable interest is currently being shown in the use of the artificial diet in cystic fibrosis.  It may be used as a supplement to ordinary food or to supply all the nutritional needs of the child.  In the latter event we believe that it is particularly important to emphasize to the parents the need for an additional source of dietary fat.  Clinical evidence and animal experiments suggest that infants, because of their rapid growth rate, are particularly at risk and that in the absence of dietary E.F.A. they will develop deficiency symptoms in about two months.\\n',\n",

There was no correlation between the clinical severity of the disease and serum AFP concentration. Samples from control groups with gluten-induced malabsorption and bronchiectasis had normal levels. Persistent synthesis of AFP may be an associated marker of C.F. genes, and estimation of serum AFP might help in detecting heterozygote carriers in families at risk.\\n',\n",

Significant concentrations of IgG and of complement complexes could be eluted from the lungs of the C.F. patients but not from those of controls.  Studies involving immunoabsorption, autoradiography, and molecular sieving through Sephadex G-200 columns identified both bovine serum albumin and staphylococcal alpha-haemolysin as two of the antigens present in the immune complexes.

The mechanical removal of such materials by volume controlled unilateral lung lavage with saline has been of benefit in selected patients refractory to conventional therapy (particularly those with alveolar proteinosis or accidentally inhaled radioactive particles).  This report describes the anaesthetic and lavage techniques currently used in managing patients with alveolar proteinosis and mucoviscidosis and in whom lung lavage repeated at approximately six-month intervals has resulted in both subjective and objective improvements.  In 14 lavages in four different patients (10 lavages in two patients with alveolar proteinosis and four lavages in two patients with mucoviscidosis) certain physiologic responses to lung lavage, particularly those related to oxygen transport, were measured quantitatively in an attempt to evaluate and to optimize anaesthetic and lavage techniques.  The maintenance anaesthetic during lavage was selected randomly, so that each patient received light anaesthesia with ketamine/diazepam during one lavage and light halothane anaesthesia during lavage of the contralateral lung.\\n',\n",

The sweat chloride test, which is reliable in diagnosis, is technically too difficult for a screening program, and only reliably detects homozygotes. In contrast, the meconium test for detecting homozygote newborns is simple, inexpensive, reasonably specific but its general application has yet to be evaluated. Detection of serum components is the basis of two new tests to distinguish patients with cystic fibrosis and carriers. The effect of these serum components on ciliary activity is the principle of one test, an extremely difficult procedure that is subjective and lacks sufficient specificity for routine use. The second test, in which serum components are separated by isoelectric focusing, may provide an objective biochemical means of detecting both homozygotes and heterozygotes.\\n',\n",

Specific IgE antibodies against these allergens were found in the appropriate subjects. In spite of this evidence of type 1, IgE, sensitization none of the patients had a history of infantile eczema. Intracutaneous tests with A. fumigatus extract gave types 1 and 3 reactions in sixteen patients (37%), only seven of whom were among the sixteen (37%) who gave positive precipitin tests.

In contrast, control females exhibited reduced spermidine and spermine levels as compared to control males. Blood from female cystic fibrosis homo- and heterozygotes showed similar results.

Between 5 and 10 per 1000 healthy infants passed meconium specimens that gave a false positive reaction with the Boehringer Mannheim test strip and contained a greater than expected concentration of albumin.  It was possible to exclude pancreatic insufficiency in all of these children by determining the ratio, albumin : alpha1-antitrypsin in meconium and subsequent faecal specimens, since it was found that values of this ratio in excess of 2.0 suggested pancreatic insufficiency of the type associated with cystic fibrosis. Three of 14 neonates with subsequently proven cystic fibrosis yielded meconium specimens giving negative test strip results and low albumin concentrations. In two of these patients, the ratio, albumin : alpha1-antitrypsin in the meconium was within normal limits but, within two months of birth, the albumin : alpha1- antitrypsin ratio in the faeces of both children was greater than 3.0 suggesting that pancreatic insufficiency had developed.\\n',\n",

Short term white blood cell cultures were established from 107 normal, healthy individuals. Cultures from 97 had no CFFA, six (No. 1-6) showed variable results and four (No. 7-10) had activity in all four tests done on a single sample. When the assays were repeated 3 months later on new cultures from these four positive CFFA individuals, two showed activity (Nos. 7 & 9) and two did not (Nos. 8 & 10). All 10 individuals whose cultures showed CFFA has histories of allergies. The association of CFFA in the culture medium derived from individuals having allergies with the intermittent presence of this activity suggested that environmental factors induced a CFF-like activity in such white blood cell cultures. The oyster ciliary assay, using medium from white blood cell cultures, cannot be used for screening for the CF heterozygote since the substitution of culture medium for serum did not eliminate inconsistent results and CFFA was not specific by this assay for the CF gene. Of the fibroblast lines established from the four persons whose initial white blood cell cultures consistently showed CFFA, only one (No. 7) showed the CF culture phenotype (CFFA positive and metachromasia).\\n',\n",
       " 'Family studies have been done to determine if the phenotypes described for the cystic fibrosis (CF) cultured cell reliably detected the CF gene. Two culture phenotypes were studied in culture derived from consecutive generations in four CF families: (1) cystic fibrosis factor (CFF) in the medium of short-term white blood cell cultures assayed by a modified oyster ciliary test and (2) the three characteristics of cultured skin fibroblasts (metachromasia without alcianophilia at 0.3 M MgCl2, CFF in the culture medium and metabolic cooperation with normal fibroblasts). As CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, the family offered a test unit for determining the specificity of these cell phenotypes for the CF gene. On the basis of detecting the CF culture phenotypes in the homozygote and obligatory heterozygotes, the parents, and their segregation in consecutive generations, detection of the CF gene was not possible in the white blood cell cultures, but was possible in the skin fibroblast cultures.\\n',\n",

These range all the way from disorders of the neonate that are closely related to parturition, to acute infectious diseases seen in infancy and early childhood, to chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis and bronchial asthma.

       " 'From 1971 to 1973, we hospitalized 41 symptomatic patients with cystic fibrosis for intensive pulmonary therapy.  The more severely ill patients were admitted more than once during this period.  Our study included 100 courses of such intensive treatment.  Garamycin pediatric injectable, containing 10 mg/ml of the active ingredient, was administered intravenously to all patients in divided doses of 3.0 to 5.0 mg/kg/day.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of garamycin when administered parenterally to cystic fibrosis patients with serious infections.  During the 100 courses of treatment, clinical improvement was rated as follows: significant or definite improvement, 39; moderate improvement, 50; slight improvement, 9; and no change, 2.  The use of garamycin pediatric injectable is safe and can be helpful in the management of the pulmonary infectious complications of cystic fibrosis when employed along with other well-established modalities of therapy.\\n',\n",

Genuine recognition of feelings by the pediatric staff can go a long way toward reassuring family members that their long-standing burden and suffering are being validated and understood.  When a family manifests early signs of difficulty in coping with the emotional and physical stress imposed by cystic fibrosis, it is helpful to refer them to a child psychiatrist for consultation.  It is primarily the families at high risk for breakdown which most require early prevention and intervention.  The role of the pediatrician as the primary clinician is crucial.  It is he who must provide the support and understanding that are integral parts of the primary prevention of emotional decompensation in this disorder.\\n',\n",

Although some parts of knowledge gained from adult studies can be used, chronic cor pulmonale in children and infants is quite a different entity from that usually seen in adults.

       " 'Lung function tests were conducted in 35 patients with cystic fibrosis and correlated to class of skin fibroblast metachromasia. Seven patients belonged to class I (vesticular metachromasia), 16 to class II (generalized metachromasia), and 12 to class III (no metachromasia).  Class I patients had significantly lower vital capacity (VC) than class II patients.  As regards the other lung function tests, no general trends were found in class I patients compared with the other two classes.  For class III patients the lung function tests reflected more serious lung changes than those of class II patients; statistically significant differences were found as regards residual volume/total lung capacity, one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), and FEV1/VC.  The differences were not due to varying intensity of treatment.  The results are in accordance with the findings in a previous study of the clinical and radiological lung symptoms and serum protein values in CF when correlated to metachromatic classes.\\n',\n",
       " 'Metachromasia of cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the assignment of the fibroblasts to one of three classes after the morphological distribution of the metachromatic staining, have been described by Danes and Bearn (1968, 1969) and Danes (1969).  In two previous studies from this hospital (Lykkegaard & Jacobsen 1975, Lykkegaard & Thuesen Pedersen 1975) the clinical, radiological, and functional severity of the lung disease and the serum protein pattern in CF patients were studied in relation to classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia.  It was found that class III patients tended to be more severely affected than class II patients, and more than class I + II patients, and, possibly, class I patients were also more severely affected than class II patients.  Sproul and Huang (1964), in a study of growth patterns in cystic fibrosis, found a significant correlation between severity of the respiratory disease and height and weight retardation.  In the present study, height and weight development in 98 CF patients are correlated with class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.\\n',\n",

The results were correlated to class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.  Fourteen patients belonged to class I (vesicular metachromasia), 52 to class II (generalized metachromasia), and 32 to class III (no metachromasia).  All patients above 16 years of age (six patients) were class II.  Simple scoring systems for clinical lung symptoms and for treatment of lung disease were developed.  When compared at the same ages, class I and III patients were more severely affected (judged by the clinical lung symptoms) than class II patients, and they had been more intensively treated.  Comparing class I + II patients (metachromatic fibroblasts) with class III patients (ametachromatic fibroblasts), it was found that class III patients were more severely affected and had been more intensively treated than class I + II patients.  As regards chest radiographs (judged by Norman's system) a similar pattern was seen, but no statistically significant differences were found.  In 68 patients (9 of class I, 35 of class II, and 24 of class III) the serum protein electrophoretic fractions were studied.  It was found that class III patients had more severe alterations than class II patients, and more than class I + II patients.  The proportion of female patients in class III was greater than in the other two classes, but this could not explain the differences.  Because of the small number of patients in class I, the differences between class I and class II patients are more doubtful than the differences between class III and class II patients, or between class III and class I + II patients.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Sera from juvenile diabetic and nondiabetic controls were tested, using the immunoperoxidase method, for the presence of islet-binding immunoglobulins. All diabetic sera tested contained an islet-binding protein and on the average the sera were more positive than age- matched controls. Normal adult sera are undifferentiated from juvenile diabetic sera. Most sera from children less than two years of age did not bind to islet tissue and sera from cystic fibrosis patients had a markedly diminished ability to bind to islet tissue. The binding protein appears to be an immunoglobulin which selectively reacts with elements of the islet beta cell.\\n',\n",
       " 'The esterolytic activity of mixed and parotid saliva in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and normal subjects was determined using BAEE (alpha-Benzoyl-1-arginine-ethylester) as the substrate. Using soybean- trypsin-inhibitor the trypsin-like activity (TLA) was measured and plotted as a function of parotid flow rate. In addition calcium, protein and pH were determined. Trypsin-like activity in mixed and parotid saliva showed large individual variations in CF and normal children. In parotid saliva we could not find any significant difference, whereas a reduction of TLA in mixed saliva of CF patients was observed. The fact that our normal values fell within the range of heterozygotes reported by Rao et al. (19), makes their hypothesis of a close relationship between reduced TLA and the genetic defect very doubtful. Protein, calcium and pH increased with augmented salivation and no difference between CF patients and normal age matched children could be found except for the pH at a flow rate above 0.75 ml/min per m2 body surface where significantly lower pH values resulted. The relevance of reduced TLA to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis is discussed.\\n',\n",

In this review only procedures for screening for hereditary biochemical disorders will be considered. Criteria for selection of genetic traits to be screened, the schedule for screening, specimens for screening, the screening of newborn infants, the testing of older infants, the testing of high-risk infants and children, the screening of families with genetic diseases, and screening for carriers in selected populations are discussed.\\n',\n",

We scored the presence of this pattern in 313 patients with congenital heart defects (including 86 with isolated VSD), 176 with cystic fibrosis (CF) or relatives of those with CF, and 333 with no known clinical disease who were unrelated to individuals with CF. The frequencies in these three groups were 1.6, 2.3, and 0.6%, respectively. None of those with isolated VSD defect had a DPAT. All five individuals in the heart defect group with a DPAT had pulmonic stenosis. Of the total of eleven individuals in our series with DPAT patterns, eight were affected only on the right hand. The frequency of DPAT in individuals with no known disease in this series was 4/406=1.0%, more than double the frequency in a control series, published previously by DAVID, 5/1,129=0.4%. If the 73 relatives of those with CF are excluded from our own 'control' group, the frequency of DPAT in this group is then 0.6%, closer to the results in DAVID's control series.\\n\",\n",

Symptoms of sinusitis seldom occurred and treatment was not generally required. Agenesis or delayed development of frontal sinuses was also seen in the majority of patients.  Nasal polyps occurred in 27% of the patients, all of whom were over five years of age.  Excluding those patients under five years of age, none of whom had polyps, the incidence was 36%.  In general, polyps were not observed in those patients with severe disease.  Mild degrees of conductive hearing loss were noted in the younger age groups especially, but no instance of severe hearing loss or nerve conduction disturbance was encountered.  Such mild degrees of hearing loss may merely reflect the application of standards too stringent for this age group. Throat and nose cultures on 26 patients revealed pseudomonas aeruginosa in eighteen cases, reflecting the flora of the tracheobronchial tree.  Other organisms were encountered on an unpredictable basis with findings consistent with those anticipated in this age group of patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'The diagnostic 10 micro-mole (0.56 mg) 59Fe2 absorption whole body retention test (Fig. 1) has now been in use for 10 years for the detection of depleted iron stores in subjects with iron deficiency (Heinrich et al., 1966; Heinrich and Bartels, 1967).  Further studies were necessary to investigate the clinical reliability of increased 59Fe2 absorption in patients with erythroblastic hyperplasia, which may control the regulation of iron absorption by iron stores.  The relationship between iron absorption and iron stores was studied in pancreatic insufficiency to reinvestigate the effect of pancreatic secretion on iron absorption.  Iron absorption in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy was investigated in order to correlate the impairment of iron absorption with the degree of villous atrophy and to study its recovery on a gluten-free diet. Dietary iron absorption was measured in patients with gastric mucosal atrophy and partial gastrectomy to investigate the extent to which iron malabsorption is responsible for the high incidence of iron deficiency in such patients.  The combination of the diagnostic 59Fe2 absorption test and measurement of the whole body 59Fe2 elimination rate is a useful routine procedure for the detection and quantification of gastrointestinal or urogenital blood loss as a cause of iron deficiency.\\n',\n",

Serum A.F.P. level was raised in patients and siblings of Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis homozygotes heterozygotes, neonatal hepatitis and ataxia telangiectasia.  It was mildly elevated in biliary atresia.  In women with previous history of a child with severe neural tube defect, raised amniotic fluid levels of A.F.P. were associated with anencephaly or spina bifida. The diagnostic utility of A.F.P. in pediatrics, especially in genetic counselling, is discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'The levels of gentamicin in blood and in secretions of the tracheobronchial tree were measured in 14 children (8 with cystic fibrosis and 6 with tracheostomy) in a cross over fashion after the administration of 40 mg of gentamicin by aerosol or by endotracheal injection. High levels of gentamicin (greater than 20 mug/ml) within the bronchial secretions were observed in 7 children after aerosolization and in 11 children after endotracheal instillation. Corresponding blood levels were low (less than 3 mug/ml) in all patients and no detectable levels were found in 10 children after aerosolization and in 6 children after endotracheal instillation. No significant differences were observed between children with cystic fibrosis and those with tracheostomy. Since intramuscular injection of gentamicin (a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg) resulted in low levels of gentamicin within the bronchial secretions (less than 2 mug/ml in 10 patients, among whom 4 had undetectable levels); it is concluded that the administration of an antibiotic such as gentamicin, directly to the trachea by endotracheal injection or by aerosolization might prove to be helpful when the infection is confined mainly to the tracheo-bronchial tree.\\n',\n",
       " 'In certain cases of obscure chronic lung disease, the possibility of a genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, should be considered. When the genetic defect fails to cause pancreatic involvement, the partial expression of cystic fibrosis is encountered. Elevation of sweat electrolyte levels is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults since normal levels vary widely in both adolescents and adults. Other tests should, therefore, be utilized. The cilia dyskinesis test is positive in both homozygous and heterozygous patients with cystic fibrosis. Utilization of this technique in a family study confirmed the diagnosis of partial expression of cystic fibrosis in an adolescent female.\\n',\n",

The absorption of cephalexin was improved in coeliac disease diverticulosis and cystic fibrosis.  In Crohn's disease the peak plasma level was reduced and delayed.  The absorption of both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole was increased in all three conditions.  However there was a disproportionate increase in the plasma level of trimethoprim in coeliac disease and diverticulosis when compared with that of sulphamethoxazole.  In Crohn's disease there was a threefold increase in the peak plasma level of sulphamethoxazole.  After cholestyramine administration there was malabsorption of all three drugs.\\n\",\n",

The sulfated glycoproteins were degraded with alkaline borohydride, and the degradation products were fractionated by chromatography on ion exchange resins and by gel filtration. The carbohydrate chains thus obtained have a wide heterogeneity with regard to acidity and molecular size. The neutral chains contain blood group H active oligosaccharides and incomplete chains as short as 1 residue of 2- acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose. The minimal size of the neuraminic acid-containing chains is less than that of the sulfated chains, which increases with the degree of sulfation. The sulfate groups are linked at C-6 at the D-galactose residues.\\n',\n",

The antibody produces a fluorescent pattern which is very similar to that obtained with an actin-specific antibody. This pattern is composed of fluorescent fibers which are shown to be coincident with the fibers seen with phase-contrast optics. High resolution epifluorescent microscopy reveals that fibers stained with the actin antibody show a continuous fluorescence, while fibers reacted with the tropomyosin antibody show a periodic fluorescence. Measurements indicate that the lengths of the fluorescent segments are variable with an average of 1.2 mum while the spacing between segments is approximately 0.4 mum.\\n',\n",
       " 'This paper describes the Data Registry System of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  Through this system an annual up-dated and corrected data base has been prepared for cystic fibrosis patients seen at U.S.A. Centers from 1966 through 1972.  From the data base, a large number of life table studies are calculated.  A study is specified by its data base, the observation period, analysis age (age year or year since diagnosis), the Centers included, and the condition of patients at birth, and possible additional factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, or race.  The annual rates of mortality are measured by a force of mortality technique.  Two techniques have been used to appraise the mortality of particular groups, graphing the cumulative survival function for the group together with the cumulative survival function for a comparative group, and calculation of mortality ratios of actual to expected deaths (by an applicable standard mortality table).  This latter approach lends itself readily to tests of significance.  For the purpose of calculating mortality ratios, two standard tables have been prepared on the basis of the 1972 Data Base and the 1966-1972 observations.  The first of these standard tables is for use with age year studies, and the second is for years since diagnosis studies.  The paper comments on the number of mortality studies by calendar year, by sex, by condition at birth, by age at diagnosis, and of survival from diagnosis of patients diagnosed in 1966-1972.  The calendar year studies indicate an improvement trend in the survival experience from 1966 to 1972 but a change may be occurring.  The study by sex exhibits a higher female mortality.  The 7% of patients who have meconium ileus at birth show a significantly higher first-year mortality, and a somewhat lower survival rate thereafter even if the first year of life experience is excluded.  Mortality data for groups specified by age at diagnosis are given.  For patients diagnosed during 1966-1972, there is some indication of better survival than for patients diagnosed prior to 1966.  The continuation of these mortality studies on an annual basis should further our understanding of survival patterns for cystic fibrosis patients.\\n',\n",
       " \"The urinary excretion of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was examined in 98 normal children and 46 children with cystic fibrosis between the ages of 9 months and 18 yr. Diurnal variations in cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion were observed in subjects from either group, and peak levels of cyclic nucleotide excretion were generally observed during the period of 0700 to 2100 h. Excretion rates (mumol/day) of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP increased significantly with age. When cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion rates were normalized for urinary creatine, or body weight, the values declined significantly with age in both groups of patients. Cyclic GMP excretion normalized for body surface area also decreased with age, while the value for cyclic AMP (2.86 plus or minus 0.08 mumol/day/m2, mean plus or minus SE) was constant with age in both normals and cystic fibrosis children. With some comparisons of age groups there were significant differences in cyclic nucleotide excretion between normal subjects and children with cystic fibrosis. The differences noted were dependent upon the methods used to normalize excretion rates (urinary creatine, body weight, surface area, and the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted). In general patients with cystic fibrosis excreted greater amounts of cyclic GMP than did normals. The most striking comparison was the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted which was 9.09 plus or minus 0.50 in all normal children and 4.41 plus or minus 0.32 in children with cystic fibrosis (P smaller than 0.001).\\n\",\n",
       " 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (173) from 144 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas in seven hospitals were serotyped with the agglutination systems of Homma (1974) and Fisher et al. (1969). The two systems were complementary. Strains from CF patients were much less likely to furnish a stable type on repetitive typing tests than strains from other patients. This was related to the frequent occurrence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. The 173 strains were divided among 11 Homma serotypes. A single Homma type (type 8) capable of mucoid growth comprised 104 (60%) CF strains. Eight serotypes were detected in 77 strains from 48 CF patients in one hospital; three strains were detected in one hospital CF unit; and two strains were detected in each of five hospital CF units. The CF serotype comprised from 50 to 93% of CF strains in the seven hospitals. These P. aeruginosa strains dissociated in vivo as judged by mucoid and nonmucoid colonies on primary culture plates and continued to dissociate during subcultures. Both colony type were the same serotype. The tendency to regard colonial phenotypes (mucoid, nonmucoid, rough) as separate strains was erroneous. Repetitive typing with the two systems gave better results than a single system. The mucoid P. aeruginosa strain is probably spread from patient to patient, rather than acquiring its mucoid characteristic de novo in the CF patient. It is not known why the mucoid CF strain has a peculiar predilection for CF patients, nor why it generally loses the quality in culture but retains it indefinitely in the patient.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have used ion-specific electrodes in an attempt to map the sodium and chloride activities on the skin under differing surface conditions. The range of values and the standard deviations are so wide that a baseline for the untreated dry skin is precluded. In patients with cystic fibrosis, a wide range of values is also found. For this group, measurements on dry skin taken immediately after washing were in the same low range as for healthy subjects. The range of measurements on the dry skin of newborn infants was similar for full-term infants with reactive sweat glands and for premature infants who failed to show sweating responsiveness to natural reflex stimulation as well as local glandular stimulation with sudorific drugs. For only two conditions have measurements of sodium and chloride activities on the surface of the skin been of value: (1) on the sweat-covered skin for the detection of the high values encountered in cystic fibrosis, and (2) on the dry skin surface, deprived of autonomic innervation (spinal paraplegia), extremely low sodium and chloride activities reflect absent gland activity.\\n',\n",

       " 'An alpha-feto-protein (AFP) is present in many mammals, in birds, and in sharks during development. The AFP present in different species have similar physicochemical properties and often have common antigenic determinants. Their study, both in health and disease, has provided a useful model for the understanding of other phase-specific antigens and the activation of the genes which control their synthesis. In the human fetus, the level of AFP falls with increasing maturity. The more sensitive methods of detection have disclosed that this fetal protein persists in trace amounts throughout life and its level increases in maternal blood during pregnancy. The principal sites of synthesis are the fetal liver and in some mammals, the yolk sac splanchnopleur. In humans as well as in mice and cows, it is notable that the synthesis of AFP is increased in liver cancer cells and that high levels of this protein are present in serum. Elevated values of AFP have also been detected in human subjects with undifferentiated tumours of the testis and ovary. A fall to normal levels has been noted in cases of complete remission after surgery and a return to high levels in patients who develop metastases. In some patients with hepatitis a temporary rise in the level of AFP has also been observed. In recent years, the detection of high levels of AFP in amniotic fluid has proved to be of great value for the prenatal diagnosis of neural-tube defects. Abnormal levels have also been found in the amniotic fluid or in maternal serum in cases of spontaneous abortion. Such measurements are now being assessed as a method of monitoring abnormal pregnancy.\\n',\n",

In infants under 3 months, excessive mucus in intrahepatic bile ducts was seen in 11 necropsies; in 15 others there were only nonspecific periportal changes. Cholestasis was found in the livers of 18 of the 26 infants. Excessive mucus in the biliary tree was occasionally associated with periportal changes and cholestasis in older infants.

A 15-year-old white male with cystic fibrosis, who has been treated at our hospital, reported hoarseness of two week's duration on a routine clinic visit in March, 1973.  In March, 1974, mirror laryngoscopy revealed a paralysis of the left vocal cord in the paramedian position, consistent with paralysis of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.  It is felt that the vocal cord paralysis in this patient with cystic fibrosis is due to compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by an enlarged pulmonary artery.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The purpose here was to test for a generalized abnormal sensitivity of the external chemoreceptive systems using a standardized method that separates sensory activity from biasing factors known to affect measurement of sensitivity.  The frequency distributions of salt taste sensitivity for patients with cystic fibrosis are given. Normal siblings and control patients did not differ statistically, and they were combined into a single control group for analyses.  The patients with cystic fibrosis did not differ as a group from the normal subjects in salt sensitivity.  There were, however, two children with cystic fibrosis with taste sensitivities well below those observed among the normal children.  No age or sex differences in sensitivity were observed.  The taste sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis did not correlate with the Shwachman and Kulczycki rating of the severity of their disease.  Of the seven children who had determinations of sweat electrolytes at the time of taste testing, three failed to excrete sufficient amounts for measurements.  Patients with cystic fibrosis, as a group, were not found to have more sensitive taste acuity than normal.  This corroborates the findings of Wotman and associates and strongly suggests that a general abnormality of the taste system is not routinely symptomatic of cystic fibrosis.  Henkin and Powell hypothesized that extremely acute taste is related to elevations in the concentration of electrolytes in sweat.  This seems unlikely since the patients given sweat tests in the present study all had the high levels of sodium and chloride characteristic of cystic fibrosis, yet all had taste sensitivities in the normal range.  Wotman and associates suggested that perhaps the severity of the disease accounts for the appearance of hypersensitivity in the chemoreceptive systems.  The clinical ratings of the severity of the disease did not correlate with taste sensitivity.\\n',\n",

This led to the development of a method for measuring very small amounts of endotoxin in biologic fluids and in human blood.  Yet, had the original observation of Cantacuzene on the large common edible spider crab been followed, this remarkable sensitivity of marine arthropod blood to endotoxin would have been recognized much earlier.  The original work of Metchnikoff on sea star larvae stimulated him to develop the major theory of phagocytosis but, until the adult animal of the same genus was re-examined half a century later, the presence of a powerful substance which selectively inhibits growth of lymphocytes following primary immunization remained unknown.  Though mucus secretion is a fundamental characteristic of most invertebrate phyla and all vertebrates, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of the secretory process; studies of the responses of specialized invertebrate secretory cells to infection have now led to a new means of studying macromolecular control of mucus secretion in man.  These three stories emphasize the continuing need to study disease as a biologic phenomenon.\\n',\n",
       " \"Of 72 patients with fibrosis, 49 harbored Enterobacteriaceae in the respiratory tract, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Colonization by two to four genera was documented in 29 subjects. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 44 of these 49 patients. The distribution of serogroups of E. coli was similar to that seen in patients with urinary tract infection. Antibody response against the O antigens of the patients' own Enterobacteriaceae was documented in 29 of these 49 children and encountered more often in patients with severe disease. Colonization by Enterobacteriaceae in the absence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was seen more frequently in children with the mild form of the illness.\\n\",\n",
       " 'In this study, we have compared two groups of children with cystic fibrosis.  One group of CF children had severe malnutrition in the first year of life, whereas the second group of CF children had not been malnourished.  The catch-up growth experienced by both the control and malnourished groups was impressive and was generally complete in terms of height and weight for age.  This finding is consistent with other reports regarding catch-up growth following malnutrition associated with celiac disease, anorexia nervosa, renal acidosis, Cushing syndrome, and hypothyroidism.  Though the malnourished group tended to have lower IQ and school performance scores, the differences were not statistically significant except for backward digit span.  That difference may indicate an organic impairment due to malnutrition or to any of several other factors. Our data fail to demonstrate any permanent or devastating effect of early malnutrition during a very rapid growth phase on the subsequent growth, IQ, and school performance in children with cystic fibrosis studied at age 7 to 10 years.\\n',\n",

These were compared with lymphocyte measurements in 68 normal children, 19 children with asthma, and 12 children with cystic fibrosis. The average diameter of lymphocytes in normal children was found to be 11.2 microns. In contrast, the average diameter of lymphocytes in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was 12.7 microns (P less than 0.0001). There were more lymphocytes with a diameter of 13 to 15 microns in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis than in normal children.\\n',\n",

Investigations confirmed the bronchiectasis, and, in the course of attempting to elucidate the course, sweat Cl and sweat Na were found to be raised.  The patient occasionally passed soft bulky stools and the Vitamin A absorption test was abnormal.  The pathogenesis, problems in diagnosis and the genetics are briefly reviewed.  This is the first proved case of cystic fibrosis occurring in a child of pure Chinese stock, and the first to be described in South-East Asia.

The potential difference (P.D.) and resistance (R.) are measured with a sensitive electrometer at 5-minute intervals over 60 minutes.  We were able to detect 90% of the heterozygotes.  The possibility of detecting the remaining 10% is present, and can, we feel, be achieved by using a more concentrated specimen.\\n',\n",
       " 'I have measured the fatty-acid profile of C.F. erythrocyte membranes in view of the fact that some variations in membrane activity have been observed with this system.  The results show that there was a lowered content of linoleate (18:2) and arachidonate (20:4) in C.F. erythrocyte membranes, and the total essential-fatty-acid content was significantly lower than either control group.  There was no significant difference in the concentrations of the other major fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, and oleate) and we could not observe any striking alteration in the concentration of any of the minor fatty-acid components of the membrane.  It would thus appear that the overall fatty-acid pattern in C.F. erythrocyte membranes is altered only by a diminution in those fatty acids which are of dietary origin.  The fact that there was considerable overlap between the C.F. and control data makes it rather unlikely that the fatty-acid profile closely reflects the biochemical lesion of the disease.  When the essential-fatty-acid levels of the C.F. samples were compared with the Schwachman clinical scores of the patients, there was a surprisingly poor correlation (r = 0.49) which was not statistically significant.  The correlation with the nutritional part of the clinical score was equally low.  Diminished essential-fatty-acid content is often observed in many acute illnesses.  In addition, the possibility exists that C.F. patients may be particularly susceptible to essential-fatty-acid depletion due to their pancreatic dysfunction.  Further research on fatty-acid transport and metabolism in C.F. is clearly needed to establish the role of essential fatty acids in the disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lieberman reported that there was considerable overlap in quantitative C3 levels between all of the C.F. subjects tested, and the control group.  His control group, however, was composed of subjects with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis, in whom C.F. had been ruled out.  The use of a more proper control group by Lieberman, either in place of or in parallel with his \"diseased\" control groups, would have provided a more meaningful interpretation concerning the role of complement in cystic fibrosis.  We agree that there is a tendency for C3 to be higher in C.F. females than in C.F. males.  Although Lieberman was quick to dispel any notion of C3a being implicated in the aetiology of C.F., he overlooked the one facet of our initial study that still makes our hypothesis feasible - raised C3 levels in C.F. obligate heterozygotes.  Hann et al. reported that serum-C5 was raised in both C.F. patients and their parents.  Our initial data on C5 levels by radial immunodiffusion and haemolytic studies do not confirm this finding.  We are supporting the hypothesis that C.F. is either a complement-caused or complement-mediated disorder, in which a C3a-like molecule (C3a, bradykinin) either alone or by complexing with IgG gives rise to the physiological and pathological state of C.F.\\n',\n",
       " \"We read with interest Dr Raine's paper but would like to stress that Hellsing and Kollberg used a single radial immunodiffusion method not radioimmunoassay.  Prosser et al. demonstrated quite clearly that similar results were obtained in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.) screening with test-strips and with more elaborate methods of albumin detection in meconium.  Using both radial immunodiffusion as well as test-strips, Kollberg's group noticed a decreased albumin content in C.F. meconium stored at room temperature and mailed for several days.  Diminished albumin concentration might have been brought about by remaining proteolytic activity.  Prosser et al. found no change in albumin content during refrigerator storage. Approximately 10% of C.F. cases have no raised albumin content in meconium and this problem has not yet been solved.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mr Stuart and Dr Burdon speculate on the possibility that the high frequency of the cystic-fibrosis gene among Caucasians may be due to the heterozygotes having some advantage in biological fitness over normal homozygotes.  They suggest that this might be due to increased resistance to typhus, once endemic in Europe, on the basis of the well-known immunological cross-reactivity between the causative organism, Rickettsia prowazeki, and certain strains of the species Proteus vulgaris, which is agglutinated by sera from cystic-fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.  However, there is no evidence that this agglutination is an immunological reaction.  It appears microscopically to be associated with disorganisation and inhibition of the bacterial flagellae leading to clumping of the organisms.  As such it is probably analogous to the effect on cilia of rabbit trachea and oyster or mussel gills.  The cilia factor, although associated with IgG, is now known not to be IgG itself and may well be the C3a component of complement.  These and other observations, such as those on salivary and sweat gland secretions and on sodium flux, suggest that all these phenomena are membrane rather than immunological effects.  Although it is possible that a Proteus flagella antigen could also be the binding site for the cilia factor, this seems improbable.  An alternative hypothesis is that heterozygotes for the cystic-fibrosis gene have increased resistance to tuberculosis.  This would meet the requirement of a common disease recently endemic in Europe at least as well as typhus, and is suggested by indirect evidence from a family study demonstrating a significantly lower incidence of tuberculosis among the parents of cystic-fibrosis patients than among parents of controls.\\n',\n",

       " 'The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is unknown.  We therefore undertook to study fatty-acid oxidation (Beta-oxidation) in patients with C.F.  There was no significant difference in the results obtained in controls and either affected individuals or heterozygous carriers.  All the values in the affected individuals lay within the normal range.  Unless for some special reason the defect is not expressed in leukocytes, these results indicate that the metabolic pathway involved in fatty-acid oxidation (Beta-oxidation) is intact in C.F.  It therefore seems unlikely that the reported deficiency of certain essential fatty acids in C.F. is the result of a defect in fatty-acid metabolism.\\n',\n",
       " 'We believe that serum-levels of individual complement components in children cannot be meaningfully interpreted unless they are compared with normal values obtained from age-matched controls.  In a study of 163 healthy infants and children we found a statistically significant correlation of C3 levels with age, but not with sex or race, and we also found a wide range of values within any given age-group.  In contrast to previous reports, we did not find raised C3 levels in the majority of our C.F. patients when the values were compared with projected group mean values for the appropriate age, and we did not find a significant elevation of the mean C3 level for the C.F. patients in any of the age-groups tested.\\n',\n",

In all, more than 150 such parents were interviewed. During the course of the interview, the Taylor manifest anxiety scale, Fouldes' personality inventory, and the 16 PF test form A were used.  It was apparent that these parents represented a wide range of personality types, and differed in no way from the general population.\\n\",\n",
       " \"patients with proven cystic fibrosis and a wide variety of Schwachman clinical scores were studied and the controls were 10 healthy children undergoing minor elective surgical procedures.  The results show that for children with cystic fibrosis there are not only decreased proportions of essential fatty acids but that 20:3 omega-9 is found in all cases.  Our results suggest that there is no intrinsic defect of the desaturating system in cystic fibrosis and that the pattern of essential-fatty-acid deficiency is entirely similar to that found in dietary deficiency of essential fatty acids.  A further significant finding is the occurance if 20:3 omega-9 in apparently healthy children, particularly the very young. This is probably diet-related and emphasises the young child's very large requirement for essential fatty acids for membrane synthesis. The need for adequate polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood cannot be overstated, whether they be for normal membrane synthesis or lowering of serum-lipids, giving possible protection against cardiovascular disease.\\n\",\n",
       " 'In three literature reports the linoleic acid (L.A.) levels for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) compared to controls are always more significantly lower than arachidonic acid (A.A.).  Similarly the percentage lowering is also more for L.A. than A.A.  There is, thus, no \"overwhelming\" evidence for a blocked or absent desaturase and the cause of the E.F.A. deficiency must be elsewhere.  We have found up to 2.5% of the total fatty acids in both serum and red cells to be C20:3-omega-9.  All of our C.F. patients have shown this acid at some stage and, for most, it is a permanent feature of their fatty acid profile.  It has been reported that C20:3-omega-9 would probably act as an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation from A.A. and it is interesting to conjecture on whether this could account for some of the symptoms of C.F.  C20:3-omega-9 would also be incorporated into P.I. and could then alter membrane properties.\\n',\n",
       " 'In an investigation of the effects of intestinal malabsorption on plasma-lipids, we compared the fatty-acid composition of the serum-lecithin of 23 patients with malabsorption from a variety of different causes and found similar changes irrespective of the underlying cause of the malabsorption.  The only exception to this was that classical E.F.A. deficiency was found only in patients whose malabsorption was due to massive small-bowel resection.  All other causes of malabsorption gave rise to changes identical to those found by other workers in C.F.; there is thus no reason to postulate an additional metabolic abnormality specific to C.F.  The relatively normal amounts of arachidonic acid reported in some E.F.A. deficient patients may not be entirely due to arachidonic acid.\\n',\n",

       " \"Mr Rivers and Mr Hassam propose that the subnormal levels of linoleic acid (18:2) found in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis are due to malabsorption.  To substantiate their hypothesis they deduce that the remarkable remission observed in a cystic-fibrosis patient given intravenous 'Intralipid' was due not to the 18:2 content of the 20% triglyceride component of the fat emulsion but to the 20:4 content of its 1.2% phospholipid component (not 6% as they state).  This explanation seems unlikely in view of the relatively small proportion of 20:4 in intralipid phospholipid, especially since intravenous administration of intralipid phospholipid to healthy subjects decreases both the 18:2 and 20:4 content of their plasma-phospholipids.  Comparison of the effects of complete intralipid versus intralipid phospholipid on the level of 20:4 in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis would soon determine whether they lack the ability to desaturate 18:2 to 20:4.\\n\",\n",
       " \"For some time now we have been using a screening test for cystic fibrosis based on levels of stool trypsin and chymotrypsin on the fourth day of life.  One interesting observation is the number of premature babies who have little or no pancreatic trypsin or chymotrypsin at this time.  For example, of the babies tested from St. Helen's Maternity Hospital between June, 1974, and April, 1975, 84 were classified as premature in the birth-records book.  Samples were received for only 65 of these babies.  Of these 65 babies, 26 (40%) had stool-trypsin levels of <100 microg. per g. compared with only 2.5% of the other babies tested during this period.  As may be expected, the lower-birth-weight babies tend to have lower stool-enzyme concentrations.  We feel that our data indicate that at least some premature babies would benefit from pancreatic-enzyme supplementation or predigested foods in the first few days after birth.\\n\",\n",

In C.F. patients and known heterozygotes, this ratio is 4 - 9 times higher than in healthy subjects.  We have tested P.R.P. from 40 healthy people, 25 patients with C.F., and 40 known heterozygotes.

Almost without exception, the children with cystic fibrosis had noticeable wrinkling of the fingers within 2 min of immersion in hand-hot water, whereas normal children showed no (or minimal) wrinkling after 10 min.  This wrinkling is due to an excess of salt in the skin, which increases water-binding capacity of keratin.  The test would thus appear to provide a simple and cheap screening method for cystic fibrosis, but one that may not be absolutely reliable.\\n',\n",
       " \"The administration of pharmacologic quantities of iodine such as iodides for the treatment of pulmonary disease, organic iodine present in medications and x-ray contrast dyes, and the ingestion of iodine-rich natural foods, may result in goiter, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism, especially in patients with underlying thyroid disease. Medications containing iodide may induce hypothroidism in euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 131I or surgically treated Graves' disease, or following hemithyroidectomy for nodules; and they may induce hyperthyroidism in patients with endemic iodine- deficient goiter, autonomous nodules or nontoxic nodular goiter, or in patients recently treated with antithyroid drugs for Graves' disease. Rarely, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may develop in patients with completely normal thyroid function during administration of iodide. The etiology of iodide-induced goiter and hypothyroidism in patients with cystic fibrosis remains obscure. Iodide-induced myxedema may also occur in patients receiving drugs which alter thyroid function, such as lithium, phenazone, and sulfisoxazole. Finally, iodides do have a role in the treatment of hyperthyroidism but their use should probably be restricted to thyroid storm, preoperative preparation of the hyperthyroid patient, and following 131I treatment.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a generalized disorder of the exocrine glands inherited as a recessive genetic trait.  The disease was more fully described as a specific entity in 1939 with a pathology of dilated ducts and fibrotic changes in the pancreas and copious secretory intraluminal obstruction of the bronchial tree.  The symptoms predominately involve the gastrointestinal tract as more frequent, bulky, malformed and malodorous stools and the respiratory system as cough, wheezing and signs of chronic respiratory obstruction.  In certain instances, only one of these two systems will have manifest symptoms and signs.  An increased concentration of sodium and chloride in the sweat was discovered in 1953.  The elevated salt concentration of the sweat has proven to be a reliable diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of the disease.  Few diseases present in so many different forms, degrees of severity and at different ages as does CF.  All present treatments for cystic fibrosis are essentially symptomatic.  Since the study of families having a child with cystic fibrosis has shown an incidence of the disease in one fourth of their siblings, classification of the disease as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder suggests that the concept of an abnormal gene related to alteration in a single enzyme should apply.  The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in childhood is an overwhelming even to the patient and his family.\\n',\n",

It may or may not be associated with steatorrhea (fatty stools). History plays a vital part in the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal disease in children.  Time spent here is often more rewarding than a battery of specialised investigations.  One must be clear what the parent means by diarrhoea, as terminology among doctors, nurses, and parents is often confusing.  When dealing with children one must always adopt a comprehensive approach and consider the whole child and his family.  Common causes, mechanisms, and consequences are discussed.  Some of the common causes of diarrhoea are cystic fibrosis, gluten-induced enteropathy (coeliac disease), Giardia lamblia, sugar intolerance, gastro-intestinal allergy, and irritable bowel syndrome.\\n',\n",

Sweat glands appear normal, but they secrete sweat with an abnormally high concentration of electrolytes.  A characteristic feature of the disease is the widespread chronic bronchiolitis.

In studies of the accuracy of dye injections to demonstrate tubal patency by roentgenogram the large errors introduced by these methods were emphasized.  Between 30 to 40 percent of tubes found blocked by using a single dye examination and using the criterion of \"filling but not spilling\" into the peritoneal cavity, or with apparent obstruction at the uterotubal junction, were subsequently found to be patent.

A number of early synonyms included congenital steatorrhea, pancreatic infantilism, and pancreatic fibrosis.  The concern of the pediatrician in the late 1930's and early 1940's was to distinguish nonfatal celiac disease from fatal cystic fibrosis.  In 1954, Shwachman presented clinical and laboratory features that distinguish these two entities.  Today one is not justified in making a diagnosis of celiac disease without a confirmatory small intestinal biopsy coupled with a normal sweat test.  A number of gastrointestinal complications in cystic fibrosis are examined: meconium ileus, intestinal obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency, lactase deficiency, intestinal impaction, intussusception, rectal prolapse, growth retardation, excessive appetite, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, gallbladder problems, and diabetes.

The assay employs isoelectric focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels to analyze microliter quantities of whole serum for the presence of a C/F factor protein and for deletions in a group of proteins called proteins B, C, and D (Fig, 1). A pH 5-10 gradient is used (Fig. 2) and each sample is screened using a serum volume which contains 300 g immunoglobulin G (IgG). Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for C/F are distinguished from normal unaffected individuals on the basis of the presence of a C/F factor protein band (Table 1). Heterozygous carriers for C/F are distinguished from C/F homozygotes 75 percent of the time, on the basis of a deletion in either band B, C, or D (Table 2). On the basis of screening 65 patients with cystic fibrosis, 61 heterozygous carriers for C/F, and 105 normal control subjects, it was concluded that no obvious correlation existed between either sex, age, or severity of the disease in the individual C/F patient, and the absolute presence or absence of the C/F factor. In addition, no correlation existed between sex or age and the presence of the C/F factor or deletions in proteins B, C, and D in the individual heterozygous carrier for C/F or normal control subjects. Analysis of serum samples from 68 patients with a variety of other diseases, many with clinical symptoms resembling those seen in the patient with cystic fibrosis (Table 3), indicated that the C/F factor protein described in this study appears to be diagnostic for C/F genotypes, with the possible exception of patients with certain types of leukemia.\\n',\n",

The mean total proteolytic activity in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-half the mean total activity in control subjects and heterozygotes. The mean proteolytic activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-third that of control subjects and heterozygotes. The relationship of arginine esterase activity to proteolytic activity was investigated. The pH optimum and action of reversible and irreversible inhibitors were similar for both activities, suggesting that the arginine esterase activity and proteolytic activity represent similar catalytic entities. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the basic defect in cystic fibrosis may reside in the deficiency of a proteolytic enzyme which results in the accumulation of the various cationic macromolecular \"factors\" described by other investigators in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The demonstration of a deficiency of proteolytic activity as assayed by the hydrolysis of protamine, a cationic polypeptide, could explain the presence of ciliotoxic cationic protein or polypeptide factors in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis and may, in some unknown manner, be related to the clinical manifestations of the disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'The ability of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA)-treated normal serum and of cystic fibrosis (CF)-affected and carrier sera to promote the release of lysosomal enzymes from sensitized human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was assessed through the measurement of beta- glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activity after exposure of these cells to the various test sera. This study was initiated to extend the analogies between preciliary dyskinesia factor (pre-CDF), separated from the cell-free media of cultures derived from CF homozygous and heterozygous individuals, and C3a anaphylatoxin. The extent of lysosomal degranulation of human PMN exposed to fresh untreated sera of each of five controls, seven CF homozygotes, and eight heterozygotes, as expressed by the amount of beta-glucuronidase releases, was 7.84% (+/- 0.934) for control sera, 14.01% (+/- 1.79) for CF-affected sera, and 10.61% (+/- 1.43) for heterozygous sera. The difference between CF homozygotes and control subjects is significant (P less than 0.0001), as is the difference between CF- affected and carrier individuals (0.001 less than P less than 0.005) and between control subjects and carriers (0.001 less than P less than 0.005), when beta-glucuronidase. However, the differences between control subjects and CF heterozygous individuals are not significant. Treatment of these sera with 1 M EACA gave values for beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase release which are slightly reduced when compared with those obtained with fresh, untreated samples. EACA apparently reduces the activity of beta-glucuronidase released from PMN. Amicon filtration studies of these serum samples demonstrated that degranulating ability and the presence of cilicary dyskinesia, as assessed by rabbit tracheal bioassay, are not always associated. Therefore, the relationship between pre-CDF and the degranulator activity in native CF-affected and carrier sera is unclear, in part because of the limitations inherent in the test systems employed.\\n',\n",

Serum protein concentration was similar in the three groups. Regardless of the units used to express activity (milligrams of protein or milliliters of serum) or whether or not samples were dialyzed against water or phosphate buffer, mean serum GR in CF was greater than in control subjects (P less than or equal to 0.002) in all series over several years. Under the above assay conditions no difference in serum GR between control subjects and carriers was detected. Calculated and assayed values of combined control and CF sera agreed as did expected and observed 50% activity in 1:2 sera dilutions in CF, control subjects, and carriers. Addition of FAD to incubation media did not effect enzyme activity in the three groups. Differences between CF and control subjects persisted after dialysis in membranes permitting passage of molecules of approximately 12,000 mol wt or less. These findings would tend to exclude the effect of extraneous serum factors in explaining the differences between CF and control subjects. The percentage of initial GR activity after four days storage (0-4 degrees) was significantly greater in CF than in control subjects (P less than 0.025). The effect of heparin on serum GR was recorded as the percentage of activity after incubation with heparin vs. activity in the standard assay for individual subjects. The effect of incubation with 5 mug/ml heparin on serum GR activity was greater in control subjects than in carriers (P less than 0.0005) and CF (P less than 0.0005). Mean serum GR activity in CF and carriers was unaffected by heparin, whereas mean activity in control subjects was decreased. In no control was the percentage of initial activity with heparin greater than the mean of CF and carrier groups. Only 3 of 20 CF and 4 of 20 carrier individuals had percentages lower than the control mean. The CF and carrier distributions were clearly different from the control distribution. Serum GR was determined in seven non-CF individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Activity in the COPD was different from CF and no different from control subjects. In none of these controls or COPD was serum GR as great as the CF mean. Serum GR in no CF was as low as the mean of control subjects or COPD. It is concluded that serum GR activity is greater in CF than in control subjects, carriers, and non-CF COPD subjects; that the difference in activity is not attributable to an extraneous serum factor, that the activity difference is not secondary to chronic respiratory disease; that in comparison with control subjects, GR from CF serum behaves differently after storage; and that serum GR from CF and carriers behaves differently from control GR in the presence of heparin.\\n',\n",
       " 'The nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina are dependent upon the function of their salt gland to maintain osmotic pressure within narrow limits. A number of drugs interfere with this function and are lethal to the nauplii. Saliva and serum from normal persons, patients with cystic fibrosis, and obligate heterozygotes were tested for lethal effect against brine shrimp nauplii. At salt concentrations between 100 mM and 2.5 no difference was found among the phenotypes. At lower concentrations a difference was noted occasionally between some normal subjects and some individuals carrying one or two genes for cystic fibrosis. Data from an independent series of experiments indicate that the naupliar deaths result from distorted ratios of Na+/K+ and not from a specific gene product. No difference was noted in the O2 uptake of nauplii treated with saliva or serum obtained from normal subjects, patients with cystic fibrosis, or obligate heterozygotes.\\n',\n",

The salivary exocrinopathy is characterized by increased amounts of PAS-reactive mucoprotein in the acinar cells and by obstruction and dilatation of ducts by precipitated material with the same staining characteristics as those found in the acinar elements.\\n',\n",
       " \"Arylsulfatase B deficiency was demonstrated in peripheral leukocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts, and a lymphoid line derived from a patient with MLS. The patient's parents demonstrated levels of arylsulfatase B that were intermediate between those found in patient and those in control subjects. The activity (mean plus or minus SD) in leukocytes from normal subjects, the patient's parents, and the patient was 113.7 plus or minus 36.2, 31.0, and 5.2 nmol 4-nitrocatechol/mg protein/hr, respectively. In skin fibroblasts of the same subjects the activity was 145.2 plus or minus 41.6, 58.5, and 7.0, respectively. Nine other lysosomal enzymes were normal in skin fibroblasts of the patient. No arylsulfatase B activity was detected in a lymphoid line established from the patient with MLS. The arylsulfatase B activity in cultured amniotic fluid cells from 10 normal pregnancies was 203.2 plus or minus 49.9.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Submaxillary saliva from reserpine-treated rats was found to have alterations in composition similar to those reported in the same secretion from patients with cystic fibrosis. Changes included elevated concentrations of Na+, Ca++, protein, and carbohydrate. In addition, this saliva was found to have ciliotoxic properties similar to those of CF serum. The similarities in cilioinhibitory effects salivary composition, and histologic appearance justify the use of the chronically reserpinized rat as a model for cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'There are several reports of secretory and other abnormalities present in cultured fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have, therefore, investigated aspects of complex saccharide synthesis and secretion by such cells compared with fibroblasts derived from heterozygous (HZ) parents and from normal (N) children. The main glycosaminoglycans produced by skin fibroblasts  during in vitro culture were hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfates, and dermatan sulfate-like materials. Using double-label experiments with D-[3H]- or [14c]glucosamine and analyzing the products by ion exchange chromatography, it was shown for five CF, two HZ, and four N lines that these polysaccharides were secreted into the medium in approximately similar proportions to each other. Moreover, experiments in which three CF, nine HZ, and three N lines were grown in log phase for up to 5 days in the presence of [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine indicate that, during such a period, CF fibroblasts do not secrete complex carbohydrates at rates significantly different from N or HZ cells. Neither do such cells shown an abnormal intracellular accumulation of complex carbohydrates. The latter observation was further confirmed by preparing whole cell autoradiographs during growth of six CF, two HZ, and three N lines in the presence of D-[3H]glucosamine and, subsequently, after addition of unlabeled medium.\\n',\n",
       " 'Polyamine concentrations have been measured in blood samples from a series of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and control subjects. Analyses were made by a fluorometric method, in which the amines were reacted with dansyl chloride and separated by thin layer chromatography on Kieselguhr. There was no significant difference between the polyamine concentrations of blood samples from CF patients and control subjects. Also, the spermidine-spermine ratio was similar in both groups. Polyamines were also analyzed in exocrine fluids, and although none could be detected in either CF or control sweat or saliva, significant amounts of spermine and spermidine were present in all samples of bile and duodenal fluids. It thus seems likely that the biliary route is a significant pathway in the human for excretion of polyamines. The observation that polyamines are excreted in considerable concentrations via the bile in children may be of interest in view of the reports of elevated urinary polyamine concentrations in neoplastic states. Since measurable amounts of spermine and spermidine were detected in all six bile preparations available for this study, analysis of these substances in bile may be of benefit in particular cases.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ten adolescent and young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) have had well-documented recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of CF in each patient was delayed because they did not have pancreatic insufficiency. The diagnosis of CF was documented by the typical pulmonary involvement and elevated sweat sodium and chloride levels in all cases and a positive family history in six of the ten patients. Two patients were diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis before the diagnosis of CF was made, thus indicating that acute pancreatitis may be the presenting complaint in the young adult with CF. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was based on the presence of severe abdominal pain, usually with vomiting, tenderness in the mid- epigastrium, elevated serum and urinary amylase and serum lipase. Attacks were precipitated by fatty meals, alcohol ingestion; postcholecystectomy and tetracycline administration. In some patients no precipitating event could be elicited. Intravenous secretin- pancreozymin stimulation tests revealed a diminished bicarbonate secretion with little effect on the secretion of the zymogen enzymes. A mild attack of pancreatitis occurred after secretin-pancreozymin stimulation. The endocrine pancreatic function tested in four patients was normal as revealed by the glucose tolerance tests and determinations of serum insulin, growth hormone and free fatty acid. Transduodenal pancreatograms were performed in three patients; one showed a normal pancreatic duct, one showed duct obstruction and in the third patient a beady type of narrowing was found. The selenomethionine Se 75 uptake of the pancreas was noted only in the head of the pancreas. This suggests that loss of function occurs initially to a greater extent in the tail and body of the pancreas. Three patients died and showed characteristic lesions of CF.\\n',\n",
       " \"There has been a recent trend to treating more and more pediatric patients with chronic diseases on an ambulatory basis.  This is true of both hemophilia and cystic fibrosis.  Despite their success in keeping slightly more than two thirds of their patients out of the hospital, I think that they might be more successful in the future if the following points are considered.  First, many of those initially selected for intravenous medications due to their nonresponsiveness to oral therapy and again later considered failures of intravenous treatment might actually be noncompliers.  My second point concerns the lack of follow-up within the patient's home.  It would seem to me that this would be an ideal place for a public health nurse to check on the patient's condition, ensure that the procedure was being properly followed under actual field conditions, and that the correct amount of medicine has been utilized. - Dr. David's letter regarding potential problems of noncompliance and home follow-up in the use of outpatient intravenous antibiotics points out the need for this type of therapy to be instituted only in those centers in which these facets can be well controlled. Public health nurses are utilized by some centers to supervise and assist in the home management of cystic fibrosis with good success.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The effects of acute diuresis in patients with cor pulmonale secondary to cystic fibrosis were studied. Both hemodynamic parameters and arterial blood gas changes were investigated. The major effect noted was a significant reduction of systemic venous pressure. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressure either remained constant or declined slightly. No consistent changes were noted in cardiac output or arterial blood gases. Acute diuresis of moderate degree appears to be a safe and effective manner in which to treat the systemic venous congestion of cor pulmonale in this situation.\\n',\n",
       " 'Eight male patients with cystic fibrosis, normal nutrition, normal physical activity, relatively mild pulmonary disease, no evidence of liver disease and no family history of diabetes mellitus underwent a series of carbohydrate tolerance tests in comparison with a group of 18 normal male subjects matched for age and body weight. Compared with the normal group, the patients with cystic fibrosis had significantly impaired glucose tolerance and significantly lower serum immunoreactive insulin levels during oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests; serum insulin levels were also significantly lower after intravenous administration of tolbutamide in the patients with cystic fibrosis, but the reduction in blood glucose concentration in each group was not significantly different. During an intravenous insulin test, the decrease in blood glucose concentration was the same for both groups, in spite of significantly lower serum insulin levels in the patients with cystic fibrosis .The percentage fall in plasma free fatty acids was at least as great in the patients with cystic fibrosis as in normals during the test procedures; while a significant decrease in plasma alpha-amino nitrogen after intravenously administered insulin was seen only in the patients with cystic fibrosis. These studies suggest that the carbohydrate intolerance of cystic fibrosis is consequent upon an impaired insulin response to glucose, but that this insulin deficiency is partly compensated for by increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin.\\n',\n",
       " 'The effectiveness of meconium screening for albumin as an indication of cystic fibrosis is examined. BM-Test Meconium was applied to 69,000 investigations. In 60 positive tests, cystic fibrosis was confirmed later. No increased albumin content was observed in four cases of cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Meconium ileus represents the earliest clinical manifestation of cystic fibrosis. The differences found in the composition and amount of protein, mucoprotein, mucopolysaccharides, and reducing sugars in meconium from newborns with cystic fibrosis might be of significance relative to the pathogenesis and early diagnosis of this disease. We studied the enzymatic activity of disaccharidases (lactase, sucrase, maltase, and palatinase) in meconium of infants with cystic fibrosis and controls. We found an increase in the specific activity of these enzymes in the meconium from infants with cystic fibrosis as compared to the specific activity in meconium from normal infants. The increase in the activities, expressed as micromols per gram of protein per minute was: lactase, 100 times higher; sucrase, 18 times; maltase, 4.8 times, and palatinase, 8.9 times.\\n',\n",
       " 'Single oral doses of 6.25 mg/kg of dicloxacillin suspension were given to ten cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and eight normal subjects. Peak serum concentrations and areas under the concentration versus time curves for dicloxacillin were variable and, on average, were 2 1/2 times lower in the CF patients. The time of occurrence of the peak serum concentration was similar in both groups and the total urinary recovery of dicloxacillin was normal or increased in the CF patients, suggesting that the intestinal absorption of the drug was unaffected by the disease. The low serum concentrations in the CF patients were caused by unusually high renal clearances of dicloxacillin which average 282 +/- 135 compared to 95 +/- 28 ml/min/1.73 sq m in the normal subjects. Creatinine clearances were also elevated in the CF patients by 55% on average, while urea clearances were normal. The serum protein binding of dicloxacillin was similar in both groups of subjects. Because the rapid excretion results in low and variable serum concentrations of the antibiotic, treatment of CF patients with dicloxacillin may warrant use of increased or more frequent doses and monitoring of serum antibiotic levels.\\n',\n",

       " \"This review of pathologic findings in cystic fibrosis includes a survey of morphologic changes from the original descriptions of CF and the numerous subsequent reports, and an analysis of 146 cases autopsied at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Billings Hospital. Achylia occurs in 85 to 90% of patients.  Approximately 1 of 7 patients with CF presents with meconium ileus.  In 1962 we described gallbladder abnormalities in 24 of 72 cases of CF (33%).  In Anderson's original description of CF, hemosiderosis was present in nearly every liver, and fatty infiltration was a frequent finding. The respiratory tract is invariably involved in CF.  The heart has never been considered a primary target organ in CF.  Bodian described a higher incidence of nephrocalcinosis in CF than in routine pediatric autopsies (31% compared to 11%).  With the increased longevity of patients with CF male sterility has become a recognized complication.  Increased electrolyte concentrations in sweat are the most diagnostic manifestation of CF, although an occasional patient has escaped this defect.  Nasal polyps are frequent and often recurrent problems in patients with CF.  Malabsorption due to pancreatic exocrine deficiency was originally described as the main manifestation of CF.  The autopsy diagnosis of CF is usually based on a combination of lesions rather than on the changes in a single organ.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Examined in this study are the results of six tests of pulmonary function immediately preceding and following bronchial drainage in twenty-six patients with cystic fibrosis. Highly significant increases averaging 5.67, 4.13, 13.47, and 6.98 percent occurred in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and inspiratory capacity respectively. Significant increases in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, and inspiratory capacity were observed in a subgroup of six of the above patients who had evidence of bronchospasm. The authors conclude that bronchial drainage will produce significant increases in routine pulmonary function values. The results suggest that this treatment is most effective in clearing the larger, more proximal, airways and is of benefit even in the presence of clinical bronchospasm.\\n',\n",
       " 'Psychophysical experiments measured both olfactory sensitivity to 1- butanol and sodium chloride and taste sensitivity to sodium chloride in normal children and in children with cystic fibrosis. The sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis fell within the normal range. These results stand in contrast to those of Henkin and Powell, who found children with cystic fibrosis to be hypersensitive to both olfactory and taste stimuli. Apparent hypersensitivity to taste stimuli could have resulted from the adapting effects of the relatively high level of sodium in the saliva of children with cystic fibrosis. If the contaminating effects of saliva are removed, children with cystic fibrosis yield, on the average, a taste threshold identical to that of normal children. There appears to be no simple explanation for why Henkin and Powell found hypersensitivity to odorants. The present results indicate that, in fact, children with cystic fibrosis display a slight hyposensitivity to odorants.\\n',\n",
       " \"The search for the basic defect in cystic fibrosis has so far been singularly disappointing.  There is no doubt that it is a disease recessively inherited, ie that the parents carry the cystic fibrosis gene without showing any signs of ill health (heterozygous) but when transmitted from both of them to an offspring this child manifests the disease, having acquired the abnormal gene in double dose (homozygote).  Cystic fibrosis is the most common of the genetically determined diseases.  Two types of cultured cells, fibroblasts and white cells from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers for cystic fibrosis, showed characteristic changes of metachromasia that seemed to allow for a classification of patients and carriers to be distributed into separate classes.  Serum from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas disorganises the movement of cilia of the isolated rabbit tracheal mucosa.  One of the early and also most constant observations is the 'viscosity' of secretions of the mucosal glands in the respiratory tract, in the alimentary apparatus, in the biliary system and in the pancreas.  A striking increase in the levels of sodium and chloride, and to a lesser extent of potassium, is present in the sweat of practically all sufferers of cystic fibrosis.  However frustrating and tantalising the outcome of research into the basic defect has been so far, the ultimate answer is likely to be astonishing in it simplicity.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Inhalation therapy can be divided into two types, intermittent aerosol therapy which is used to administer medications over brief periods and mist tent therapy which is used for prolonged periods of treatment.  The present state of knowledge of the basic defect of cystic fibrosis makes it impossible to give hard and fast guide lines for the use of inhalation therapy.  Much depends on the individual experience of the physician and the degree of pulmonary involvement of the individual patient.  Response to bronchodilators can be assessed relatively easily, assessment of mucolytics and antibiotics is difficult.  Antibiotics can be useful in helping to clear infection in those patients with early disease, as judged by clearing of pathogens from the cough swab or sputum.  In patients with chronic cough and large volumes if purulent sputum with positive culture from gram negative bacteria, the cultures never become negative and only in the occasional patient can definite clinical benefit be claimed. A few severely ill patients have dramatically improved when this therapy has been introduced, and the patients are convinced of the benefit of this treatment.  It is of course impossible in this disease, with such a varying clinical course, to prove scientifically that the inhalation therapy was the reason for this improvement.\\n',\n",
       " 'Physiotherapy for adolescents and adults with cystic fibrosis is continued along the same lines as for younger patients, but certain modifications may be necessary to fit in with their changing needs. When patients are transferred from the care of the paediatrician to the thoracic physician it may be helpful for them to be admitted to hospital for reassessment.  During this admission, the opportunity can be taken to review the daily physiotherapy regimen with the patients and their parents.  Postural drainage, the use of aerosols, breathing exercises, long-term follow-up, complications (haemoptysis and spontaneous pneumothorax), the use of intermittent positive pressure breathing, and terminal care are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is a genetically determined disorder.  The evidence that cystic fibrosis is inherited in this way comes from several sources.  The birth frequency of cystic fibrosis is unexpectedly high in Britain for such a serious illness.  It is easy to calculate the proportion of the population who are carriers from the birth frequency of the disease.  The explanation of the unlikely high birth frequency of cystic fibrosis in Europe is not known.  An attempt to reduce substantially the birth frequency of cystic fibrosis will become possible once it is practicable to detect reliably the carrier of the gene.\\n',\n",
       " 'The importance of regular efficient postural drainage cannot be emphasised too strongly.  Most parents of pre-school and primary school children are young enough to be physically able to play a major role in the routine physiotherapy treatment.

       " 'The manifestations of cystic fibrosis make it a complex disease, in the management of which the respiratory physician, the microbiologist, the gastroenterologist and last but not least, the psychologist, all are or should be involved.  About 1 in 10 babies with cystic fibrosis are born with acute intestinal obstruction due to plugging of the small intestine with very sticky meconium. Diagnosis is made by the test for excess salt in the sweat, and although possible very soon after birth, it is easier to carry out at about three weeks of age when the baby sweats more freely.  The great majority of children, if not treated, tend to suffer progressively more frequent chest infections or chronic chest infections.  The reason for the tendency of the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis to become colonised by harmful bacteria is not known.  Most cystic fibrosis children absorb carbohydrate normally, but only about 50% (range 45% to 80%) of the protein and fats they eat.  The only other major problem for which any active measures may be required is the occurrence of fibrosis of the liver in about 5% of these children. Children with cystic fibrosis should be brought up from the beginning to be like other children.\\n',\n",
       " 'With improvement in the treatment of children suffering from cystic fibrosis and increase in the average survival to about 17 years of age, many more patients with this disease are now coming under the care of thoracic physicians.  In nearly every patient, broncho-pulmonary disease is the major problem.  Pneumothorax is encountered in about 15% of the older patients and some of these occur bilaterally.  A few patients develop refractory airways obstruction and then a trial of steroids is justifiable.  Most patients with cystic fibrosis also require treatment for their pancreatic insufficiency.  Diabetes mellitus is more common in cystic fibrosis than in the normal population.  Analysis of sweat is essential for diagnosis.  The psychological stresses imposed upon patients and their families are very great.\\n',\n",
       " \"The emotional distress associated with cystic fibrosis is considerable.  From the moment of diagnosis, delayed or not, the parents' problems multiply and for the most part these problems are at first only vaguely comprehended.  Many parents embark on the long haul of caring for their child in almost total ignorance of the disease and its implications.  The fact that the disease is inherited is of outstanding importance to the parents.  The basis of genetic counseling in the disease is the explanation of recessive inheritance.  Even when genetic counseling has been given effectively and the parents have decided to have no further children, the family planning problem is not yet solved.  The physiotherapist is also necessarily concerned with the emotional state and behaviour of the child.  Except in the latest stages of this disease the child's emotional distress is not directly related to the discomfort of his symptoms.  Over-protection by parents is understandable but it is important to persuade them that it is undesirable.  Perhaps the most difficult questions of protection arise in relation to the child's knowledge of his own disorder.  Cystic fibrosis is a miserable disease and the cause of much distress, emotional and otherwise.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cystic Fibrosis (fibrocystic disease of the pancreas) is a common inherited disease which, to date, still has a fatal outcome.  The diversity of clinical manifestations and pathological findings has added further to the mysterious nature of the disease, as have the tantalizingly conflicting results of biochemical, physical and experimental studies in many laboratories of the western world.  One of the most constant clinical observations is the viscosity of the secretion of the mucosal glands in the respiratory and alimentary tracts, in the ducts of the biliary system and in the pancreas.  In approximately 10 to 15 per cent of all patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the earliest manifestation, meconium ileus, occurs in the neonatal period.  In the remaining 85 to 90 per cent of affected infants the symptoms generally become evident within the course of the first year of life.  The lung symptoms tend to dominate the clinical picture in the vast majority of untreated patients and will ultimately decide the outcome.  The lower respiratory tract is not the only part involved: nasal polyps and the accumulation of viscous secretions in the paranasal sinuses with subsequent bacterial infection are not unusual.  Pancreatic deficiency is present in the vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis and consists of a gross reduction or complete absence of exocrine secretion.  Although some histological damage has been seen in the neonatal period in infants suffering from meconium ileus, in general the full-blown picture of extensive cirrhosis, with portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhages from oesophageal varices, is seen in the older child and adolescent. Screening of the newborn to enable the institution of protective measures before lung complications arise has been attempted with various techniques.  Management includes diet and pancreatic enzyme replacement.  The treatment of pulmonary disease is the most important aspect of care in patients with cystic fibrosis, and its prevention is priority number one in the over-all management.  The outlook for the child born with cystic fibrosis depends to a large extent upon the avoidance, or delay until adult life, of the two complications that threaten his existence: cor pulmonale and cirrhosis of the liver.\\n',\n",
       " 'An account is given of screening for the early detection of disease in Great Britain today.  The organisation of screening programmes provided nationally for the whole population is described.  These include programmes for prenatal care, screening of infants, screening of schoolchildren, and screening of women for carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix.  Selective screening programmes for tuberculosis and for various industrial diseases are mentioned. Experience in provision of these services on a national scale has emphasised the importance of evaluating future screening programmes, before they are implemented, by research studies on their effectiveness, their possibly harmful side effects, and their cost. Evidence from research in screening for a number of diseases is very briefly summarized, and it is concluded that there may be some development of programmes for the early detection and treatment of hypertension and of breast cancer, but for other diseases and for multiphasic screening, evidence so far available is insufficient to warrant any immediate extension from research towards service.\\n',\n",

There was also under consideration the evaluation of body reaction on antigenic stimulation and administration of gammaglobulin preparations.  In order to determine more broadly the development of these humoral immunity parameters in children qualitative and quantitative investigations of immunoglobulins were undertaken also in same chosen illnesses where changes in biosynthesis and metabolism of immunoglobulins may be connected with pathogenesis of illness or with type of treatment (cystic fibrosis) (C.F.), Ataxia-Telangiectasia syndrome (A-T), pituitary dwarfism, fenyloketonuria (PKU).

Three methods of measuring growth indicated that under our conditions, CF fibroblasts divide normally with a  mean doubling time of 29 hr. During the logarithmic growth phase, however, lower cell protein/DNA ratios were observed consistently in CF cultures. This difference was not present in contact-inhibited, confluent fibroblasts. The finding of an apparent reduction in protein synthesis during rapid division, coupled with an observation by others that CF fibroblasts fail to normally induce collagen formation, suggests the possibility of a disturbance in the biochemical regulation of protein synthesis.\\n',\n",

A decrease in sweat chloride concentration after insulin iontophoresis in comparison with the vehicle was observed in both the CF (P smaller than 0.005) and heterozygote (P smaller than 0.01) samples.

Lobectomy may prevent a hemorrhagic death if the hemorrhage source can be identified and if involvement of the remaining lung tissue is mild. Selective bronchial arteriography was performed in six patients with cystic fibrosis to localize a lobar source of bleeding. Arteriographic findings correlated with bronchoscopic observations. Bronchial arteriography may be helpful when bronchoscopy cannot be done because of continuous hemorrhage or because the severity of the lung disease precludes general anesthesia, but it is not an adequate substitute for bronchoscopy in most patients.\\n',\n",

The reaction of the bronchi was studied both by inhalatory and exercise provocation. Inhalatory tests were monitored by means of a whole body plethysmograph. Free- range run was used for the exercise test, and the peak expiratory flow rate was measured. The described technique of inhalatory tests was accurate, safe, and not tiring for the patient. No distinct difference in bronchial reaction between the two groups of patients could be stated. The bronchial reaction to the inhalatory and exercise tests was stronger in both groups than in normals but not as strong as in asthmatics. The nature of bronchial hyperreactivity in those patients is still unknown. The inhalatory test seems to be more sensitive than the exercise test in detecting that hyperreactivity.\\n',\n",
       " 'An incidence of the genetic recessive disease cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) far in excess of that reported recently from other countries, has been encountered in the South West African Afrikaner. This has probably resulted from the immigration of a segment of the South African Afrikaner population rich in the gene, into South West Africa, where, for religious reasons and reasons of geographical isolation, the gene has persisted and, perhaps, increased in frequency. Malaria, which killed many of the early settlers, might have selectively spared carriers of the gene, thus enriching its occurrence in the population. Details of patients, particularly with regard to the criteria of diagnosis, are given with the relevant population and birth figures, from which an estimate of the incidence of the disease and of its carrier rate has been made.

Cystic fibrosis is inherited as a Mendelian recessive, and is the commonest of all such genetic diseases in the Caucasoid populations of Western Europe and North America.  Super has detected and documented a frequency of the disease among Caucasoids in South West Africa which is considerably higher than that found anywhere else in the world.

Minute amounts of amylase belonging to the pancreatic group of isoamylases might be produced by the glands of the proximal duodenum. The specific group of isoamylases produced in the female genital tract could not be demonstrated in serum or urine. The activity of amylase in serum was derived from two groups of isoenzymes, one group originating from the salivary glands, the other from the pancreatic gland. The contribution of each of these two sources to the total serum amylase was determined from early foetal life to adult age. A very low activity of the salivary isoamylases was regularly found in serum from 14-week-old foetuses. The activity increased steadily with age and reached the normal adult level, about 80 U/l, at the age of 5 years. The pancreatic group of isoamylases in serum developed later; the majority of children below 3 months had no demonstrable pancreatic isoamylase activity. The activity rose slowly to reach adult level, about 80 U/l, at the age of 10 to 15 years. The activity did not vary with sex, and the diurnal variation of the isoamylase was negligible. In children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the activity of pancreatic isoamylases in serum was low.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sera from 84 patients with cystic fibrosis, 31 patients with other respiratory diseases and 21 control persons have been investigated for the occurrence of antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies. Preciptins were studied by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis, antinuclear factors by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and rheumatoid factors by the latex fixation slide test. A very heterogeneous antibacterial immune response was found in patients with cystic fibrosis, notably as regards Ps. aeruginosa. None of the other patients or controls had precipitins against this bacterium. The occurrence of precipitins against St. aureus and D. pneumoniae were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients as compared with controls, but not as compared with other respiratory disease patients. No significant differences were found as regards precipitins against H. influenzae or the occurrence of rheumatoid factors. Antinuclear factors were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients than in the other two groups investigated. A pronounced and heterogeneous humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with mucoid strains of this bacterium was found to be correlated with poor prognosis and the reason for this is discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'The concentrations of nine plasma proteins were determined by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis in sputum specimens from 29 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and from 24 patients with severe asthma and chronic bronchitis. The results suggested that the population of CF patients could be divided into two groups in spite of an absence of difference in clinical status between the groups. Average concentrations of seven plasma proteins in sputum of group I CF patients were identical with those in sputum of patients with bronchitis, but the average concentrations of six of these proteins in sputum from group II CF patients were higher than those in specimens from the bronchitic patients and were similar to corresponding concentrations in sputum from patients with asthma, all of whom were examined while in status asthmaticus. The average concentrations of 14 secretory proteins were the same in all sputum specimens whether or not they were produced by patients with cystic fibrosis, asthma or bronchitis. It was concluded that the concentrations in the bronchopulmonary secretions of proteins associated with host defence were not diminished in patients with cystic fibrosis, and failure to produce adequate concentrations of proteins with antimicrobial activity was unlikely to be responsible for the above average susceptibility to chest infection in cystic fibrosis. It is suggested that there exists a group of CF patients in whom a pulmonary allergic reaction generates an inflammatory response as severe as that characterizing status asthmaticus and that this response could be detrimental.\\n',\n",
       " \"The hearts and lungs of 36 patients dying of cystic fibrosis have been studied to establish the relationship between right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), pathological changes in the pulmonary circulation, and the clinical features. The presence and degree of RVH were measured by Fulton's technique of weighing the ventricles separately. Of the subjects who died after the age of 3 years, one in six had no RVH, although the mean age of this group was not significantly different from that of the remainder. There was no correlation between duration of cyanosis, haemoglobin levels, and RVH. Although not statistically significant, the cases without RVH tended to have had clubbing of the finger-nails for longer periods before death. The electrocardiogram was useful in the diagnosis of RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy was common in children with lungs of large volume as judged by the radiographic centile of lung length. Cases with RVH show reduced background haze in the arteriogram and fewer arteries per unit area of lung. For the first time thickening of the medial muscle layer proportional to the degree of RVH has been demonstrated, only in the smaller arteries. Arterial subintimal fibrosis is more common in cases with RVH, as is thickening of the walls of small pulmonary veins. The implications of these findings are discussed.\\n\",\n",
       " 'This study was done to determine the role of the Wright peak flowmeter for evaluation of pulmonary functions in children with cystic fibrosis.  Peak expiratory flow rate was measured with the use of a Wright peak flowmeter and one second forced expiratory volume, maximal mid-expiratory flow rate and maximal voluntary ventilation were measured with a spirometer in a total of 55 children, 25 of whom had cystic fibrosis disease, with the remainder being normal.  Measurements were repeated after administration of bronchodilating drugs to the cystic fibrosis patients.  All the values of the four measurements were decreased significantly in the cystic fibrosis patients.  Positive and significant correlation co-efficients were obtained by comparing the peak flow rate with other spirometric measurements.  It was concluded that peak expiratory flow rate is a feasible and useful measurement of pulmonary functions in cystic fibrosis patients.  No changes were observed after administration of bronchodilating drugs to these patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'The clinical and morphological findings of 37 cases of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas from 525 full, but non-consecutive necropsies are presented.  All of these 37 cases were diagnosed at post-mortem examination.  The autopsy incidence was 7% and none of the cases was beyond two years of age.  Morphological findings revealed varying severities in organ involvement in all cases, with absence of fibrosis of the pancreas in some.  In only two cases histopathological changes seemed to be confined to the pancreas. This study suggests that cystic fibrosis plays a considerable role in infant deaths in our country and in most if not all cases the diagnosis must necessarily be based on postmortem studies.\\n',\n",
       " 'Although it is generally true that most male patients with cystic fibrosis are infertile due to congenital atresia or absence of the vasal structures, this finding is not invariable.  Taussig et al. reported 2 well-studied patients with cystic fibrosis who had normal semen analysis, and at this writing both have fathered children.  A third patient with normal semen analysis also is known to us.  In addition there are many instances of presumed but undocumented paternity in these patients.  Cystic fibrosis centers estimate male fertility at 2 to 3 per cent; although low, this figure warrants semen analysis before assuming sterility.  In view of this, we feel that the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should be considered when the vasa are absent, but it is incorrect to exclude the diagnosis on the basis of palpable vasa.\\n',\n",
       " 'Infertility and abnormalities of the mesonephric derivatives are common in patients with cystic fibrosis, but it is not a uniform finding.  Taussig et al. reported on 2 patients with cystic fibrosis who had proved fertility.  Abnormalities of the vas could be documented in pathologic studies, but the vas was found to be present in some patients who died of cystic fibrosis.  In many patients, absence could not be ruled out on physical examination.  In healthy, young children the vas is not easily palpable; even when it is, the degree of certainty in its identification is less than in the post-pubertal male.  Cystic fibrosis is a disease with protean manifestations, and it would be a mistake to rule out cystic fibrosis just because the vas can be palpated or to have victims of cystic fibrosis labeled as infertile.\\n',\n",

       " 'In 36 children with cystic fibrosis (CF), the isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase (AP) were determined microelectrophoretically in polyacrylamide- and starch-gel.  The study was done to evaluate the clinical significance of these additional data for the diagnosis of liver involvement in CF.  The results lead to the following conclusions.  Serum activity of total AP is comparatively unsensitive \"masking\" alterations in the isoenzyme pattern contributing to the AP serum activity.  In 17 children resp. 47% bile-duct phosphatase was increased indicating a secretostasis while other marker enzymes of cholestasis were normal in part.  The activity of bone phosphatase in the serum showed a significant correlation to the degree of growth retardation in these patients. Intestinal phosphatase was present in the serum of only one child with cirrhosis of the liver being an indicator for liver insufficiency.  Determination of AP isoenzymes in the serum may provide additional information about the organs involved for the physician in handling CF patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'Total amylase activity of serum and mixed saliva was studied in homozygotes and heterozygotes for mucoviscidosis and in healthy subjects. Mean serum total activity was 269.0 +/- 113.7 U/l in the homozygotes, exceeding in nearly 50% of the cases the values given in the literature and those observed in the normal controls. The difference against the control group was significant (P less than 0.05). Mean serum total amylase activity of heterozygotes agreed with the mean value for the healthy group (203.5 +/- 79.5 U/l) without a significant difference. Total amylase activity in the saliva of homozygotes (148.700 +/- 65.700  U/l) was higher than in the heterozygotes /118.300 +/- 74.200 U/l) of the healthy children (51.700 +/- 26.500 U/l). The difference between the homozygous and healthy groups was strongly significant (P less than 0.01), and that between the heterozygous group and the combined healthy children and adult groups was also significant (P less than 0.05). In the heterozygotes, salivary amylase activity was slightly elevated but not significantly different from the control group and did not result in a change in serum total amylase activity.\\n',\n",
       " 'Nitrogen- and lipid absorption coefficients were studied in 62 patients with cystic fibrosis, aged 2/12 to 12 years, and compared with the results obtained in 20 normal children.  In 59 of the 62 patients nitrogen- and lipid absorption were grossly abnormal. Age-linked differences were not found.  The efficacy of two pancreatic enzymes preparations was found to be similar.  Both preparations produced the same significant improvement in the absorption of proteins and lipids.\\n',\n",
       " \"We investigated the airway's response to exercise in cystic fibrosis (CF).  Due to the reported high incidence of allergy in CF we tried to demonstrate the well documented post-exercise bronchospasm of asthma in patients with CF.  Subjects ran on a treadmill for 6 minutes at a speed of 3 miles per hour and a gradient of 15 degrees. For the 12 controls studied, the mean % rise in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) during exercise was 4.7% and the mean % fall in PEFR during recovery was 0.7%.  For the eight atopic asthmatics studied the mean % rise in PEFR was 12.2% and the mean % fall in PEFR was 33.7%.  For the 29 patients with CF, the mean % rise in PEFR was 20.3% and the mean % fall in PEFR was 3.1%.  Patients with CF showed no statistically significant post-exercise constriction compared with controls, while asthmatic patients showed a post-exercise % fall in PEFR significantly greater than seen in controls (p < 0.001) or in CF patients (p < 0.001).  No patient with CF showed post-exercise bronchospasm, nor was there any difference between patients with CF who had positive skin tests to common allergens and those who did not in their pattern of bronchial liability.  It is suggested that the general desensitization therapy should not be instituted in patients with CF merely on the basis of positive skin tests, without more stringent criteria such as characteristic seasonal variation in respiratory symptomatology, family history of atopy and positive bronchial inhalation provocation tests.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Although forty years have passed since the discovery of the clinical entity called (for lack of a better name) cystic fibrosis, its treatment remains both symptomatic and controversial.  Moreover, the efficacy of therapy has been difficult to evaluate for several reasons: the lack of a suitable animal model for therapeutic experimentation, the protean manifestations of the disease, the natural variations in its severity, the prolonged periods of observation that are required by its very chronicity and frequently the lack of satisfactory clinical parameters by which to score response.  Stated in its simplest form, the treatment of cystic fibrosis is directed towards the long-term control of salt loss, malabsorption and bronchial obstruction, the management of several complications of the disease and the establishment of a positive therapeutic environment that minimizes anxiety and depression.  The purpose of this review are to help the pediatric practitioner gain security in his day-to-day management of children with the disease and to advocate an effective working relationship between the practitioner and a regional cystic fibrosis or pediatric pulmonary center for long-term patient management.  Problems in diagnosis, treatment of salt loss, the prevention and treatment of malabsorption, the prevention and treatment of bronchial obstruction, the prevention and treatment of certain complications, and the psychosocial support of the patient and family are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " \"The intrauterine detection of genetic disorders represents one of the exciting advances in medicine.  The major emphasis in this chapter will be a detailed review of the newer approaches toward antenatal detection of congenital malformations and hemoglobinopathies as well as an overview of the experience and problems of antenatal detection for chromosomal aberrations and inborn errors of metabolism. Approaches to prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, visualization of the fetus, and fetal blood sampling. Prenatal detection of genetic disorders has become a reality.  The area is evolving so rapidly that the major indications for intrauterine diagnosis have substantially changed within the past year.  Prior to this time, maternal age, previous Down's syndrome, inborn errors of metabolism and X-linked recessive disorders were the primary criteria, with approximately 85% of the cases being used for cytogenetic analysis.  Within the past year, in a number of laboratories, about half of the referrals for amniocentesis have been for central nervous system defects.  Certainly with the development of technics for fetal blood sampling, this distribution of the frequencies of indication may, once again, change substantially. Most probably for the next few years cytogenetic abnormalities and neural tube defects will be the most common indications for amniocentesis.  Amniocentesis will continue to be offered to many patients with inborn errors of metabolism and probably will be available for monitoring of hemoglobinopathies and other disorders of fetal blood as well as for accurate knowledge of the health of the fetus.\\n\",\n",

       " 'A 51/2-month-old infant had the single problem of a bulging fontanelle. A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with secondary hypovitaminosis A was made by the findings of high sweat chloride values and a low serum carotene level. A greatly accelerated rate of weight gain following the addition of pancreatic enzyme supplements confirmed the presence of malabsorption. The infant developed characteristic fibrosis pulmonary disease at 20 months of age. Animal studies have shown vitamin A deficiency to be associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, diminished absorption of CSF, and pathological findings of thickening and infiltration with mucopolysaccharides of the dura mater around the arachnoid villi.\\n',\n",
       " 'Pneumothorax occurs in 2% to 4% of patients with cystic fibrosis following rupture of subpleural blebs into the pleural space.  Death can occur, and recurrences have been reported.  Therapeutic procedures include needle aspiration, closed thoracotomy drainage, open thoracotomy with pleural scarification, or intrapleural instillation of irritants.  When injected into the pleural space, the antimalarial drug quinacrine hydrochloride evokes an inflammatory response; the resultant fibrosis produces a tight adherence of the visceral and pleural surfaces.  Quinacrine therapy for pneumothorax has been frequently used in adults, but there are few pediatric case reports.\\n',\n",
       " 'The biliary tree of 66 patients with cystic fibrosis was examined by conventional roentgenographic methods. Forty-five per cent of the oral cholecystograms were judged abnormal by our criteria. A study was considered abnormal if there was no visualization or if there was visualization of a microgallbladder or structural abnormality including marginal irregularities, septate gallbladder or cholelithiasis. Intravenous cholangiography was used to further study the 22 patients who did not visualize on the oral study. Again, anatomic abnormalities were prevalent but six patients in this group had normal appearing gallbladders. Abdominal pain, a frequent symptom in cystic fibrosis, was not associated with roentgenographic abnormality. No correlation was seen between the external biliary tree abnormalities and multifocal biliary cirrhosis which was present in 40% of these patients. Further, no correlation was seen between serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels and either of these lesions.\\n',\n",
       " 'The gene frequency for slow and fast electrophoretic variants of complement C3 in Caucasian individuals with cystic fibrosis was similar to the values expected for unaffected controls, thereby ruling out a suspected differential involvement of these phenotypes with the disease.

       " 'In a study of C3 levels and phenotypes in 64 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, 92 CF parents, 64 normal siblings, and 126 healthy controls, significant elevations of mean C3 levels were found in CF patients, their parents, and in one genetic sub-group of their siblins (SS females). C3 concentration in CF patients correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by Shwachman-Kulczycki (S-K) score. No significant differences were found in the prevalences of C3 phenotypes or the S and F gene frequencies among the groups studied.\\n',\n",
       " 'Prior genetic studies of the human pancreatic amylase (Amy2) locus have been directed principally to the electrophoretic analysis of serum and urine, on the assumption that these fluids receive negligible contributions from the salivary (Amy 1) locus. In support of that assumption was the observation that the isozyme bands were lacking in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a postpancreatectomy patient. We have examined the sera of 97 patients having cystic fibrosis and find normal levels of serum amylase. On electrophoresis, three-quarters of the cystic fibrosis patients have a pattern (F- pattern) not observed in normal sera. The pattern is characterized by the absence of Pa 1. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the F-pattern is of salivary origin and is unmasked in cystic fibrosis by the absence of a pancreatic contribution. The normal serum pattern is considered to be an admixture of salivary and pancreatic amylase. On the assumption that duodenal fluids might more closely reflect the pancreatic (Amy 2) locus, electrophoretic studies were performed on 148 normal individuals and 37 individuals with cystic fibrosis. Electrophoretic phenotypes in duodenal aspirates are more complex than previously reported in studies of urine and serum; presumably because of the higher concentrations of amylase in the aspirates. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the phenotypes observed in duodenal aspirates also reflect admixture of pancreatic and salivary amylase. This recognition of pancreatic and salivary admixture in sera fortunately does not alter our prior understanding of the genetics of the Amy 2 polymorphism. The extensive studies which led to the delineation of the Amy 2 polymorphism were essentially based on the presence or absence of a variant band which proves now to be outside the zone of admixture.\\n',\n",
       " 'Transit time analysis of the forced expiratory vital capacity maneuver was applied to 37 patients with cystic fibrosis 8 to 22 years of age. This analysis divides the vital capacity into segments of air and assigns a transit time to each segment. The characteristics of the distribution of these transit times are used as measurements of pulmonary function. The quantities were compared with the forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, ratio of 1-sec forced expiratory volume to vital capacity, peak flow, forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity, maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of the vital capacity, specific airway conductance, and arterial PO2 of these patients. The standard deviation of the transit times was the most frequently abnormal. The mean transit time had the largest range of values in terms of its own standard deviation, and it was the best single estimate of over-all lung function because it correlated almost equally with large and small airway function. The coefficient of cariance of transit times was specific in detecting abnormality of small airways and was as sensitive in the detection of minimal lung disease as the standard deviation of transit times.\\n',\n",
       " 'The incidence of serum IgE antibodies to several species of aspergillus and the incidence of serum precipitins to these species and to Candida albicans were determined in 22 children with cystic fibrosis, 17 children with bronchial asthma, and 18 control subjects. IgE antibodies were found in 50 per cent of the patients with cystic fibrosis and in 29 per cent of the patients with bronchial asthma; none was found in the control subjects. Precipitins to aspergillus species were present in 59 per cent of the patients with cystic fibrosis, 35 per cent of the patients with bronchial asthma, and 11 per cent of the control subjects. Greater differences were noted when the total number of precipitin bands in each group was compared. There was a trend for the more severe cases of cystic fibrosis (based on the Shwachman-Kulczycki score) to have a greater incidence of precipitins and a lower frequency of IgE antibodies to aspergillus than the milder cases. Candida precipitins were found more frequently in patients with cystic fibrosis (45 per cent) than in patients with bronchial asthma (18 per cent); none was found in the control group. The potential role of fungal hypersensitivity in cystic fibrosis and the therapeutic implications are discussed in light of these findings.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent lethal genetic syndrome among white children and is the cause of much of the chronic progressive pulmonary disease encountered in children.  Because of the increasing adolescent and adult population of patients with cystic fibrosis and their psychosocial, employment, and treatment needs, this review, whenever possible, will emphasize aspects pertinent to older patients.  No known biochemical or structural defect will account for all the pathophysiologic phenomena of cystic fibrosis. Thus, the definition of the disease rests on the clinical findings; cystic fibrosis is a syndrome, and not yet a disease.  Incidence figures for cystic fibrosis are necessarily minimal.  The best diagnostic efforts currently available fail to detect all those who die at a young age or who have mild symptoms.  Several pieces of evidence indicate that cystic fibrosis is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.  An autosomal recessive inheritance for cystic fibrosis suggests a discrete biochemical or structural defect.  To date no single lesion has been proved to provide a unifying hypothesis for the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis.  Exocrine gland dysfunction, mucociliary transport, immunology, ciliary factors and transport mechanisms are discussed.  The manifestations of cystic fibrosis involve many organ systems and the pattern of presentation is variable.  Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and sweat gland manifestations are discussed.  There are at least 3 possible approaches to screening for cystic fibrosis: sweat testing, evaluation of pancreatic function, or detection of some product of the defective gene.  Prenatal diagnosis and heterozygote testing, diagnosis in adults, and diagnostic problems are also examined.  Treatment includes prevention, pulmonary therapy, and gastrointestinal therapy. Pulmonary and other complications and their treatment are discussed, as well as psychosocial aspects, and evaluation and prognosis of cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'In this study, the potential problems and discrepancies in cill culture techniques were avoided by isolating leukocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy human volunteers and preparing homogenates to determine the specific activities of 5 lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradation of glycoproteins. Four lysosomal hydrolases involved in the breakdown of the carbohydrate side chain were assayed using artificial substrates. The fifth enzyme, aspartylglucosamine amido hydrolase, which cleaves the linkage between this side chain and the peptide backbone, was assayed with natural substrate. No differences in enzyme activities between the 2 leukocyte sources were observed. Because no enzyme activities were deficient and no compensatory increases were noted, we concluded that the thick, glycoprotein-rich, exocrine secretions in cystic fibrosis cannot be attributed to a defect in their catabolism.\\n',\n",
       " 'The pulmonary function records of 132 patients with cystic fibrosis followed for 5 to 7 years were reviewed. Changes in forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity, and 1-sec forced expiratory volume as a percentage of forced vital capacity were examined. There was considerable variation in the rates of change, but the general pattern was consistent with a theory of exponential decline, mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity showing the earliest and most dramatic changes. The pulmonary function of 33 patients (25 per cent) remained stable or improved throughout follow-up, possibly reflecting mild forms of lung disease or the efficacy of therapy. Twenty of these patients (15 per cent) maintained completely normal pulmonary function. The rate of decline in pulmonary function values, with progress of the disease, was steeper in the female patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'The author has attempted to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding dispositional processes in infants and children of various ages.  The traditional processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are described not only in newborn infants but also in infants and children of other age groups.  Knowledge of the effects of age and the effects of diseases, which are often unique to each stage of postnatal development, upon drug action and disposition is a vital and necessary prerequisite to a discussion of interactions of drugs of abuse in the pediatric population.  It is essential that the developmental status of the host be taken into consideration when examining interactions of drugs in infants and children.  The mechanisms of interactions are similar to those seen in the adult patient.  The developmental status of the pediatric patient also plays a significant role in the manifestations of disease seen in sick infants and children.  These are often profound and consequently may play a major role in modifying drug action and interaction.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mucous glycoproteins were isolated by agarose gel filtration from nonpurulent tracheobronchial secretions and purulent sputum which had been reduced, carboxymethylated and, in the case of purulent secretions, treated with deoxyribonuclease.  The solubilized and purified glycoproteins were fractioned on diethylaminoethyl cellulose into two major (I, II) and two minor (Ia, III) blood group active components.  Components I and II had similar carbohydrate and amino acid compositions which were typical for human blood group substances.  These two components did differ in several respects. Component I contained 1.4-2.6% sulfate and did not inhibit influenza virus hemagglutination while component II contained 7.1-7.8% sulfate and was a potent inhibitor of virus hemagglutination.  Component II also migrated more rapidly on sodium dodecyl sulfate-3.3% acrylamide gel electrophoresis.  Components I and II in purulent secretions displayed only minor compositional differences from their counterparts in nonpurulent secretions.  Component II was more abundant in two sputum samples from subjects with cystic fibrosis than in purulent bronchitic secretions or in nonpurulent secretions.\\n',\n",
       " 'Submandibular secretions collected from children with cystic fibrosis (CF) showed increased protein concentrations (milligrams/milliliter) and increased amylase specific activity (units/milligram of protein) relative to normals secretions.  These differences between normal (N) and CF secretions were as follows: protein, 1.25 plus or minus 0.51 (N), 1.75 plus or minus 0.35 (CF) (P < 0.02); and amylase, 58 plus or minus 18 (N), 80 plus or minus 19 (CF) (P < 0.001).  To determine the basis for elevated protein in CF saliva, several major proteins resolved by polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis were quantitated by densitometry.  These included four phosphoproteins (PP), serum albumin, an acid phosphatase-containing fraction, amylase, and an unidentified protein referred to as PI-7.1.  Together, these proteins comprise greater than 75% of the total protein in the secretion.  Differences in individual protein concentrations (milligrams/milliliter) resolved from normal and CF secretions, respectively, were as follows: PP2, 0.02 plus or minus 0.01, 0.03 plus or minus 0.02 (NS, not significant); PP3, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.05 plus or minus 0.03 (NS); acid phosphatase fraction, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.12 plus or minus 0.07 (P < 0.05); amylase, 0.09 plus or minus 0.04, 0.27 plus or minus 0.16 (P < 0.01); and pI-7.1, 0.04 plus or minus 0.02, 0.13 plus or minus 0.08 (P < 0.02).  Amylase, the most significant contributor to the elevated protein, comprised 26% of the total protein of normal secretions and 38% of the total protein of CF secretions.  Thus, our results do not support the concept of a generalized increase in all organic components in CF submandibular secretions but, rather, increases in specific proteins, namely amylase, component pI-7.1, and an acid phosphatase-containing fraction.\\n',\n",

       " \"I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their disappointment at not finding any difference between the life expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age. Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.\\n\",\n",
       " 'During a screening programme for the detection of CF using the meconium albumin technique, the overall false-positive rate was found to be approximately 1%. When the gestational age of the infants was taken into account the false-positive rate was found to be significantly higher in preterm (8%) as compared to term infants (0.55%). This was due largely but not solely to the presence of occult blood. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed and attention drawn to the limitation of meconium albumin content as a screening technique for CF in preterm infants.\\n',\n",
       " \"A new technique of measuring stool enzyme activity on dry specimens of faeces from newborn children at 4-5 days of age has detected 3 cases of cystic fibrosis in the first 6000 tests. No known cases of cystic fibrosis have been missed. Additionally, one case of pancreatic achylia of at least 4 months' duration has been detected. It is proposed that the detection of cystic fibrosis by this technique is sufficiently practical to be acceptable as a worthwhile newborn screening programme.

       " 'Faecal specimens from 51 infants free of cystic fibrosis (CF) and from 9 infants with the disease were analysed for albumin and alpha1- antitrypsin content. Faeces from infants with no CF had a mean albumin content of less than 0-1 mg/g dry weight and a mean albumin: alpha1-antitrypsin ratio value of less than 0-1. Faeces from infants with CF had, with one exception, an albumin content of more than 2-0 mg/g dry weight and a ratio value greater than 3-0. It was subsequently found that the duodenal aspirate from the child with CF but whose faeces had a low albumin content and ratio value, had tryptic activity though at a much reduced level compared to the activity in aspirates from healthy infants.\\n',\n",

This is consistent with the idea that atopy arises as a result of impaired handling of antigen at mucosal surfaces. The allergic CF children had more chest infections, a worse chest x-ray appearance, and lower peak expiratory flow rates. Allergic diseases were also frequent in the CF obligate heterozygotes (32% of mothers and 26% of fathers). It is suggested that the heterozygotes may also have a mucosal abnormality resulting in defective antigen handling.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mucociliary tracheal transport rates were measured in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis, in whom these rates ranged from 0 to 12.8 mm/min. The patients were divided into 3 roughly equal groups on the basis of their transport rates. (1) Those in whom no abnormality in mucociliary transport was detected in the trachea; (2) those in whom normal transport rates were measured but in whom abnormalities such as cessation, or reversal of bolus movement were observed; (3) those in whom no normal transport rates were observed. In the first group the rates were similar to those observed in a population of healthy adults. These normal rates were observed in some patients who had a productive cough. The mean mucociliary tracheal transport rate increased with increasing maximum midexpiratory flow. Those patients with a low Shwachman score and poor arterial oxygen tension tended to fall into groups 2 and 3. In the ciliary dyskinesia assay in rabbit trachea the serum from the patients with the higher transport rates tended to initiate more rapid discharge of material from the epithelium and ciliary dyskinesia.\\n',\n",
       " 'Well children show a steady increase of staphylococcal precipitins throughout life.  Lower incidences are found for precipitins against H. influenzae, Pneumococcus, and haemolytic streptococcus. Precipitins against Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Klibsiella are rare. There are marked differences between the normal children and the cloxacillin-treated children with cystic fibrosis in respect to Pseudomonas and H. influenzae which rise to over 50% of cystic fibrosis children in the third quinquennium.  However, the development of staphylococcal precipitins can be prevented by continuous antistaphylococcal therapy.\\n',\n",
       " 'Peliosis hepatis, which has previously only been reported in adults, occurred in a chronically ill 11-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis. As in cases in adults, chronic illness, long-term anabolic steroid therapy, and right ventricular congestive failure may well have been the causative factors in this case. Histologically, the phlebectatic and parenchymal types, which were presumed to be separate, were found conjointly in this case. This is compatible with its origin from severe right ventricular congestive failure. The rarity of peliosis, however, indicates that one or more as yet unknown factors might be operative in its development.\\n',\n",
       " 'The fundamental pathological observations in cystic fibrosis (CF) were made over three decades ago.  More recently, physiological findings have directed investigation toward a plethora of humoral substances and their possible role in disturbances of the secretory processes in CF.  The application of the techniques of molecular biology and of tissue culture is beginning to increase our knowledge about the so-called CF factors and their diverse effects on epithelial and ciliated surfaces.  Emphasis in current research is on the chemical characterization of the CF factors, the metabolism of cells cultured from patients with CF, and the biochemical events controlling the processes of secretion.  Some current theories as to the metabolic pathogenesis of CF are considered in the context of existing findings.\\n',\n",
       " 'Tests for airways obstruction based on a forced expiration were carried out in 60 children with asthma and 15 with cystic fibrosis to determine which test or tests were the best in identifying children with airways disease, to determine the severity of disease and to document response to therapy.  Maximum expiratory flow, measured from a maximum expiratory flow volume curve, and maximum mid-expiratory flow measured from a spirogram, were the most sensitive tests in detecting early disease.  Maximum expiratory flow measured from the maximum expiratory flow volume curve, combined with measurement of lung volumes, gave the best overall estimate of severity.  Peak expiratory flow rate measured with a Peak Flow Meter, because of its simplicity of measurement, was the most useful test for routine use in the clinic and consulting room to monitor severity and response to therapy.\\n',\n",
       " 'Disease in the small airways leads to alteration in the slope of phase III of the single breath nitrogen washout following a breath of 100% oxygen.  Normal children and those with asthma and cystic fibrosis were studied by this technique.  Measurement of the slope of phase III of the single breath washout appeared to be a sensitive indicator of abnormal pulmonary function in children with these diseases.  Results obtained in many children with cystic fibrosis suggested that the upper lung regions were predominantly affected.\\n',\n",

       " 'Alpha2-macroglobulin from patients with cystic fibrosis is shown to have reduced binding with papain, trypsin, and thrombin.  The obligate heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis revealed intermediate values between the controls and the patients.  Since papain and trypsin are not plasma endopeptidases, it becomes evident that the absence of alpha2-macroglobulin-protease complex in cystic fibrosis is due to a molecular defect within the macroglobulin.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis at one time was considered to be a lethal condition with death occurring at birth or within the first year of life.  With the advent of antibiotic therapy, pancreatic enzyme replacement, extensive physical therapy and generally improved medical treatment, many patients now survive to adulthood.  Clinical manifestations in CF vary from patient to patient and may include pulmonary disease, malnutrition, pancreatic insufficiency and defective ion transport. The most reliable laboratory method for diagnosis of CF is testing for elevated sweat electrolyte levels.  Estimates of the incidence of CF vary from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 3500 among white populations of mid-European heritage.  The disease is rare in black populations and almost non-existent in Orientals.  Since 1967 there has been an intensive search for a circulating factor or factors which may be directly or indirectly responsible for the malfunctions manifest in this disease.  Sweat factors, serum factors, metachromasia, bioassay variations, and properties of the ciliary inhibitor are discussed. Several groups working in CF research have centered their attention on the serum complement system.  Agglutination and mucus factors, transport studies, enzyme studies, and prenatal diagnosis are also examined.\\n',\n",
       " \"Previous studies have shown an abnormality of the spermidine-to- spermine (Spd/Spm) ratio in whole blood of cystic fibrosis homo-and heterozygotes. To investigate Spd and Spm distribution amoung blood components as a possible cause of the abnormality, blood was fractionated using Rabinowitz's glass bead technique and Boyum's Ficoll-Hypaque method. Free (unconjugated) polyamines were  extracted with perchloric acid and quantitated on an amino acid analyzer. In controls, mean +/- SEM concentrations in nmoles/10(9) cells of Spd and Spm, respectively, were 1.02 +/- 0.08 and 0.894 +/- 0.28 for erythrocytes; 126 +/- 31 and 357 +/- 105 for lymphocytes; 36 +/- 16 and 240 +/- 33 for granulocytes; and less than 0.5 and less than 0.5 nmoles/ml for plasma. When converted to the concentration in whole blood, it was found that greater than 90% of Spd and over 70% of Spm was associated with erythrocytes. While the higher cellular concentration in leukocytes was not unexpected, the fact that Spd and Spm in whole blood were primarily associated with erythrocytes was a new finding. Comparison with controls revealed that the Spd/Spm ratio in both whole blood and erythrocytes was significantly higher in the group of cystic fibrosis patients.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Leucocytes from 26 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 18 healthy controls were investigated by migration inhibition induced by a variety of antigens. In patients with CF cell-mediated immunity was found to human lung and pancreatic tissue extracts as well as to Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and food antigens but not to brain, heart, or kidney. Those patients with the severest form of the disease had the greatest impairment of cell-mediated immunity, but this impairment could be reversed by steroid treatment. Cell- mediated cytotoxicity may also be concerned in the pathogenesis of CF.\\n',\n",

These three children with cystic fibrosis clearly illustrate the danger of the present unusual climatic conditions.  The necessity of salt supplementation in these environmental circumstances should be emphasised to all concerned and, above all, to parents.  The danger of the administration of salt-free glucose solutions also should be borne in mind.  In the past the case has been argued for a safe electrolyte solution that would be commercially available.  In the absence of such a readily available form of electrolyte-glucose solution parents will need explicit instructions on how the salt supplement should be administered.\\n',\n",
       " 'Eleven episodes of \"meconium ileus equivalent\" have been seen in six adults with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. Three patients were initially treated surgically; one died and the other two developed serious postoperative chest infections. Six episodes were successfully treated medically with acetylcysteine orally and by enema, nasogastric suction, and intravenous fluids. Operation should be avoided if possible, and maintenance treatment with acetylcysteine may be necessary to prevent relapse.\\n',\n",
       " 'We agree with the comment of Dr Feighery and Mr Woods that a low migration index signifies sensitivity to an antigen which can be achieved only by functionally active immunocompetent cells.  However, we must emphasise that the functions of active immunocompetent cells may or may not be impaired, depending upon the antigens to which such cells are sensitised.  Since comparative cells from age-matched controls and from blood donors did not show such sensitisation to those antigens to which the cystic fibrosis cells were sensitised then there is no doubt that the normal function of these immunocompetent cells in the patients with CF is indeed impaired. When one considers that steroids are known immunosuppressants it is certainly not surprising that treatment of the CF patients with prednisolone caused a decreased sensitivity of these sensitised CF cells to the antigens.  Indeed, therapeutic concentrations of steroids were able to reduce the ability of sensitised spleen cells and of lymph-node cells to destroy target cells in vitro.  Apart from this inhibition of sensitised cells by steroids, 90% of sensitised lymphocytes were killed when prednisolone 1 mg/l was present during the sensitisation phase.  In addition it was observed in man that if cortisol or prednisolone was given two hours before abrading the skin, then there occurred a marked reduction of emigrations of both mononuclear cells and polymorphs into the area, thus inhibiting the mobilisation of macrophages.  We believe that the situation with regard to steroid therapy and inhibition of migration of leukocytes from CF patients is similar.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis (CF), like syphilis, could accurately be described as \"the great imitator.\"  Many organ systems are involved, and a clear understanding of the disease and its many complications is a useful exercise in understanding human physiology.  CF could be called thick-secretion disease, because all exocrine fluids, like pancreatic juice, are thick, or it could be called multimystery disease, because there are so many unanswered questions about it.  Many manifestations of CF are understandable complications of malabsorption, malnutrition and the physical and chemical effects of abnormal exocrine secretion; others, including the susceptibility to recurrent nasal polyps, the hypersalinized sweat, low female fertility and male sterility, given present knowledge, do not make physiologic sense.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fibroblasts derived from individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis, an inborn error of metabolism, have been found to be more easily transformed by simian virus 40 than are cells derived from normal individuals. The increased susceptibility does not seem to depend upon changes in glycoprotein at the cell surface. Repeated observations were necessary to demonstrate these differences, and we do not believe that this test is suitable for routine screening for cancer susceptibility.\\n',\n",
       " 'Injections of serum from human patients with cystic fibrosis into adult rats caused pronounced structural modifications and increased mitotic rate in the parotid gland. Mitotic rate was increased from a low level of 0.02/1,000 acinar cells in parotid glands of adult rats to 6.5/1,000 acinar cells after 2 or 3 days of serum injection. At the light and electron microscopic levels, significant acinar cell atrophy and degranulation were observed. Cellular necrosis, and increases in quantity of lysosome-like dense bodies, mast cells, and macrophages were also detected. These changes are suggestive of tissue response to injurious foreign protein. Furthermore, the fact that normal sera pronounced the same kind of effects (but greatly reduced in extent) strengthens the view that these effects result from the immunologic response of the host organ to foreign antigen. Since, however, the responses of the rat parotid to cystic fibrosis serum were considerably more marked than those elicited by normal serum, the rat parotid may thus have potential usefulness in assaying for the presence of human cystic fibrosis factor.\\n',\n",
       " 'A number of investigations have been used for the first time to examine the secretory IgA (SIgA) system in different body fluids from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Free J-chain was detected in all the sputum specimens examined. The isolated free secretory component (SC) from CF sputum differed in electrophoretic mobility from the SC isolated from normal human colostrum. In addition the free SC from some CF saliva formed precipitin lines of partial identity with normal human saliva or colostrum. A higher proportion of CF sera (33%) than of normal sera (10%) contained free SC. These investigations suggest that there may be some defect in the synthesis and/or the assembly of the SIgA immunoglobulins, which if confirmed, may help to explain the impaired Type I and Type III allergic manifestations in patients with CF.\\n',\n",

If the tests is adopted, confirmatory tests should be available. Quantitative analyses of sweat for sodium by flame photometry and for chloride by silver titration and ion-sleective electrodes are now used as confirmatory tests. We compare results of these confirmatory methods applied to presons with cystic fibrosis, respiratory disorders, or digestive disorders, and to control subjects.\\n',\n",

The tests were carried out on 165 normal persons, 64 known cases of CF, their 67 parents and 18 sibs. The tests measured sodium in fingernails by activation, sodium in saliva and chloride in saliva and in thermal and pilocarpine-induced sweat by means of ion-specific electrodes, and chloride in pilocarpine-sweat by the standard titrimetric method. The tests ranged in complexity from simple screening methods to individual clinical procedures. None of the simpler tests matched the standard pilocarpine method in diagnostic efficiency, whether they were used singly or in combination.\\n',\n",
       " \"Acid-thermostable ribonucleases were isolated from human pancreas, duodenal contents, liver, spleen, serum and urine, and purified 15-- 1000-fold. The pH optima, ionic requirements, and some of the specificity requirements, of these enzymes were investigated. The isolated enzymes formed two distinct groups: (a) The ribonucleases of the pancreas, duodenal contents and fraction A of serum and urine exhibit a pH optimum of 8.5, are inhibited by An2+ and Cu2+, and relatively rapidly hydrolyze the synthetic substrate uridine 3'- (alpha-naphthylphosphate); (b) the ribonucleases of the liver and spleen, and of fractions B of the serum and urine, with a pH optimum of 7, are less sensitive to An2+ and Cu2+, and exhibit negligible activity versus uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate). Determination of the serum level of pancreatic-type ribonuclease activity, with the use of uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate) or RNA as substrates, appears to be a valid diagnostic tool for pancreatic fibrosis in children.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Prolactin is credited to have a role in the maintenance of electrolytic and water balance by the kidneys although its effect on the composition of sweat is unknown.  We assayed prolactin, growth hormone and alpha-fetoprotein in the sera of 69 children with cystic fibrosis attending the Hospital for Sick Children.  Sera from 12 children without cystic fibrosis were used as control.  It appears that children with cystic fibrosis have serum levels of prolactin, GH and alpha-FP similar to those without this disease and that children have significantly higher levels of alpha-FP than women of reproductive age.\\n',\n",

The protein band with an isoelectric point of pH 5.48, previously reported to be absent in homozygote cystic fibrosis sera, was found to have a pI of 5.25. It was present in approximately one-half of the homozygote and heterozygote sera tested, and absent from 18 percent of control sera. The presence of this band is not therefore a reliable marker for the normal gene, and cannot be used to identify the heterozygous carrier for cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

By this method AFP with alpha mobility was not found in sera from healthy individuals, patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, secondary liver cancer and cystic fibrosis. In some of the sera, AFP was elevated when measured by conventional radioimmunoassay method and the sera contained an AFP- like substance with gamma mobility when analyzed by radio-crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The nature of this gamma substance is still obscure and needs further investigation.\\n',\n",

The isolated glycosaminoglycans were fractionated by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, analyzed for glucosamine and galactosamine content, and subjected to hydrolysis with bovine testicular hyaluronidase. The total glycosaminoglycan content, the per cent glucosamine and galactosamine, and the distribution of cellular glycosaminoglycans in circulating lymphocytes in cystic fibrosis were no different from controls.\\n',\n",
       " 'The isoenzyme pattern of alpha-L-fucosidase was studied by isoelectric focusing in livers from seven patients with cystic fibrosis and in normal and pathological (GM1-gangliosidosis, Type II and Sanfilippo disease) controls. The controls had very reproducible patterns consisting of seven isoenzymes of alpha-L-fucosidase with the most neutral from (I) representing a small proportion of the total activity. All seven of the cystic fibrosis livers had altered alpha-L-fucosidase isoenzyme patterns. The chemical relationship of the seven isoenzymes of normal liver alpha-L-fucosidase was investigated using neuramindase. The five most acidic forms of alpha- L-fucosidase appear to be related to the most neutral form by sialic acid residues. Since the isoenzymes of liver alpha-L-fucosidase appear to be related by sialic acid residues, it is possible that the altered alpha-L-fucosidase isoenzyme patterns found in cystic fibrosis livers may result from aberrant sialylation.\\n',\n",
       " 'Skin fibroblast cultures from an adult population of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have been studied to determine any possible genetic or clinical significance of the two classes described for cultured CF skin fibroblasts (Danes 1973). On the basis of clinical course, the 46 adult patients from 43 unrelated families studied were divided into two groups (40 typical, 6 atypical). The cultured fibroblasts from 37 of the 40 patients with typical CF were Class I (metachromatic, cystic fibrosis factor activity (CFFA) in the culture medium, and metabolic cooperation with normal fibroblasts), and the cultures from the remaining three patients were Class II (ametachromatic, no CFFA in the culture medium and no metabolic cooperation with metachromatic CF fibroblasts). During the 4-year research period one of the 37 patients from Class I and all three Class II patients with typical CF succumbed. The cultured skin fibroblasts from two of the six patients who had an atypical course for CF were Class I and four were Class II. When the parents of three of these atypical CF Class II patients were studied, the cultured fibroblasts from one parent in each family in each family were Class I and the other Class II. The affected offspring from such Class I-II matings may represent genetic compounds.\\n',\n",

'Fast isoamylases' are generated, at least in part, from the 6 isoamylases of the basic pattern by deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues. This basic pattern is present in the parotid saliva of all subjects we have tested so far. A shift in the equilibrium between amidation and deamidation processes is discussed in terms of its possible significance for the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and for ageing.\\n\",\n",
       " 'This is a report of five infants eventually proven to have cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, who presented with hemolytic anemia and edema. Since the sweat test is often unreliable in edematous states, the possibility of cystic fibrosis should be considered.

Evidence of vitamin E deficiency in some of the cases is presented, and the possibility of this as a cause of anemia is raised.\\n',\n",
       " 'Vitamin A absorption tests using vitamin A palmitate and alcohol separately in oil and oil-water emulsions were done on 43 patients with cystic fibrosis. Patients were given 7,000 units of vitamin A per kilogram of body weight with a fatty breakfast. Pancreatic enzymes were not given with the test meal and were withheld for five hours from start of test. Blood was drawn before administration of the vitamin and at three and five hours after administration. Serum vitamin A levels were estimated using the Carr-Price technique. The percentages of patients with normal vitamin A absorption were 85 with vitamin A alcohol in oil-water emulsion, 61 with vitamin A alcohol dissolved in oil, 64 with vitamin A palmitate in oil-water emulsion, and 19 with vitamin A palmitate in oil. The number of stools per day is an inverse indicator of retention time in the intestine. Absorption of fat soluble vitamins is always abnormal when a patient has four or more stools a day. The observations that cystic fibrosis patients with abnormal liver biopsies have poor absorption of vitamin A were not statistically significant. The question of the effect of cirrhosis in cystic fibrosis on vitamin A absorption remains unresolved.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sera from 32 patients with cystic fibrosis classified according to fibroblast metachromasia into three classes have been analysed immunochemically for the concentrations of 18 serum proteins.  In addition, the clinical and radiological status of the lungs were evaluated, using two scoring systems.  Eleven of 16 serum proteins differed from the values of a thousand-donor serum pool.  The most pronounced differences from the control sera were elevated acute-phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, IgG, and IgA, and low serum albumin and alpha2-HS-glycoprotein. Patients from metachromatic class III presented the most pronounced rise in acute-phase proteins and, furthermore, significantly decreased complement C3 and IgM, IgG and IgA were normal in class III patients.  These differences from the control sera possibly reflect inflammatory tissue damage involving immune reactions.  The clinical score was positively correlated to the radiologic score, and both these scores were positively correlated to the concentrations of eight and seven, respectively, of the serum proteins, and negatively correlated to three of the serum proteins.  Based upon the correlations between the scores and the concentrations of some of the serum proteins, it is recommended that longitudinal prospective studies follow individual patients for the concentrations in serum of haptoglobin, albumin, IgA, IgG, C3, and, eventually, IgM and alpha1-antichymotrypsin.  The present results suggest that these serum proteins will yield valuable information as regards prognosis and therapy of the lung disease in CF.\\n',\n",
       " 'Unusual increases in the minor hemoglobin components (Hb AIa, b, c) known to be elevated in diabetes mellitus were found in states of relative or absolute insulinopenia: diabetic ketoacidosis, steroid- induced diabetes, insulin-dependent diabetes in cystic-fibrosis patients, and cystic fibrosis occurring in infants who have a marked suppression of insulin secretion. In ketoacidotic diabetics, it required at least a month for high Hb AI levels (16.9 +/- 2.6 per cent) to stabilize at nonacidotic levels (12.8 +/- 0.3 per cent), suggesting that decreases occur only as new red cells form under conditions less favorable to Hb AI synthesis. Abnormal amounts os Hb A and Hb AI resisted removal from diabetic red-cell membranes by low ionic buffers but yielded to hypotonic Tris buffer. Their removal resulted in simultaneous elution of peripheral and integral membrane proteins. It is suggested that Hb so firmly bound could reduce membrane elasticity and cell deformability, characteristics so vital to normal red cell movement through the microvasculature.\\n',\n",
       " 'A simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of steatorrhea is described. The method is based on the assessment of the difference of specific gravity and lipophilic property between a normal stool and that in steatorrhea, using a benzene-NaBr system. The stool samples are dried, pulverized, and then investigated. Steatorrhea is defined either as a fat or more in a 24-hour sample. Stool samples of 71 infants and children were examined. Among these were 23 healthy subjects, 10 with upper respiratory tract infections, and 6 with pneumonia. A further 31 children had celiac disease, 9 of them were on a gluten-free diet, and one child had cystic fibrosis. The procedure described renders single stool samples suitable for the assessment of steatorrhea. As a screening test the method proved to be rapid and accurate in the diagnosis of steatorrhea.\\n',\n",

From these results a strong defect in red cell salt transport seems improbable. Valinomucin induces shrinking (by increase of K+ permeability) and gramicidin D induces swelling (by increase of Na+ permeability) of normal erythrocytes. Addition of C.F. sweat to normal erythrocytes induces no volume change. From this result no influence of the \"C.F. factor\" on passive ion permeability is concluded.\\n',\n",

In cystic fibrosis patients 97.5% and in normal children 95% of the alpha1-fetoprotein values were within the normal range for healthy adults (1--9 ng/ml). Critical judgement of the reported findings in literature and our own results demonstrate that the investigation of alpha1-fetoprotein in the serum cannot serve for detecting homozygotes of cystic fibrosis genes or heterozygote carriers.\\n',\n",
       " 'The interrelationship of enterokinase and trypsin activities were investigated in 133 infants and children with a variety of gastrointestinal and pancreatic disorders. Fourteen patients with diarrhea and grade II mucosal injury revealed a significant (P less than 0.01) reduction of enterokinase, trypsin, and disaccharidase activites as compared to 59 children with normal mucosa. Nine patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency had normal mucosal enterokinase activity and elevated intraluminal enterokinase activity with very low or no trypsin activity. Patients with hypoproteinemia and gastrointestinal protein loss, associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia (4 patients) and intestinal lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (3 patients), had normal or insignificant decrease of enterokinase and trypsin activities. In patients with steatorrhea, a normal sweat test, normal intestinal mucosa, and absent trypsin activity, two entities were defined. One group (3 patients) was diagnosed as Schwachman-Diamond syndrome with pancreatic insufficiency and normal mucosal and intraluminal enterokinase activity.

       " 'Fifteen (2.2%) of 693 patients with cystic fibrosis seen over an 18- year period developed clinical hepatic disease. In 13 patients all symptoms were secondary to portal hypertension. Ten had hypersplenism and 6 had variceal bleeding, including 3 who developed both conditions. All 5 patients who survived the initial episode of gastrointestinal bleeding underwent portal systemic shunting. A shunting procedure also was performed on 1 patients with hypersplenism but no variceal bleeding. No subsequent deterioration of intellectual function occurred in either the shunted or unshunted patients. Only 1 of the shunted patients showed progression of hepatic disease after surgery. These results suggest that portal systemic shunting is useful in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in cystic fibrosis. A sweat test to rule out cystic fibrosis should be included in the evaluation of any teenage or young adult patient with unexplained portal hypertension.\\n',\n",
       " 'This review is concerned with the disturbances in bile flow that occur early in life.  Although cholestasis is defined physiologically, it can be considered to have morphological features. Morphological cholestasis is the presence of bile pigments in histopathological sections of the liver and is most easily recognized as bile plugs or thrombi in bile canaliculi.  Physiological cholestasis, a reduction in bile flow, is inferred from the finding of an elevated serum bile acid.  This inference is derived from the known positive correlation between canalicular bile flow and bile acid excretion that has been found to occur in all species this far examined, including man.  An increase in the amount of bile acid in plasma implies a reduction in the hepatic transport of the primary conjugated bile acids of man and therefore a decrease in associated canalicular bile flow.  Classifications of cholestatic syndromes, functional abnormalities, and therapy for cholestasis syndromes are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bile acid loss (mg/m2 24h) in the stools of 43 cystic fibrosis (CF) children with pancreatic insufficiency was 751-1 +/- 48-3, while that of six without clinical evidence of pancreatic disease (133-4 +/- 15- 9) did not differ from values in 25 controls (109-8 +/- 9-8). There was a good correlation between the degree of bile acid (BA) and fat sequestration. Concomitant changes in bile acid and fat loss were observed in the one group of six patients studied on and off pancreatic enzymes as well as in a second group of seven children treated with pancreatic supplements and maintained on a normal diet followed by a low fat diet supplemented with medium chain triglycerides. Administration of NA bicarbonate led to a significant decrease in fat loss (15-8 +/- 2-7 leads to 10-3 +/- 1-9) without any simultaneous change in bile acid excretion (533-1 +/- 58-3 leads to 500-4 +/- 58-6). Qualitative bile acid patterns in controls, in infants after an ileal resection, and in patients with CF or with coeliac disease showed that the percentage of primary BA followed closely the total amount excreted except in situations where antibiotics were administered. The exact mechanism for the increased loss of BA in CF is unknown. It is found in all age groups and is related to the presence and degree of pancreatic insufficiency. The possibility that unhydrolysed triglycerides may interfere with the intestinal absorption of bile acid needs further confirmation.\\n',\n",

The mean dry mass (total protein) values exhibited greater intercellular variability among CF cells.  The dry mass:DNA ratio was higher in CF than in normal controls, and this ratio appeared to increase concomitantly with advance of disease.\\n',\n",

Post mortem examination revealed in the pancreas and the small intestine changes suggestive of a cystic fibrosis. Since the exogenous administration of galactose by diet could be excluded the endogenous production of significant amounts of galactose-1-phosphate has to be considered.\\n',\n",
       " 'Although the incidence of pseudomonas infection is low in the total hospital population, certain conditions predispose to such infection, which can be life-threatening.  Patients with cystic fibrosis are a special group, since a majority have chronic pulmonary infections with pseudomonas, often of a mucoid variant rarely found in other patients.  Several approaches are being tried in CF patients, but none shows much promise thus far.\\n',\n",

       " 'The autopsies of 82 patients with cystic fibrosis were reviewed with respect to pathologic changes in the lungs and their respective prevalence among different age groups. Although bronchitis, mucopurulent plugging, and bronchopneumonia were almost universally present among children of all ages, epithelial metaplasia and bronchiectasis were rarer among infants and progressively more prevalent in older age groups. Emphysema was absent in patients under two years of age and affected 11 per cent of the patients two to six years of age and 40 per cent of the patients older than six years, but was never of a severe degree by the point count method. Pulmonary hemorrhage, although uncommon, was usually associated with prominent arterial vessels in walls of bronchiectatic airways. Quantitative assessment of bronchial glands revealed Reid indices significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis when compared to noncystic fibrosis patients, but there was no increase in these indices with the age of the patients. Glandular hypertrophy, predominance of mucous acini within glands, and goblet cell hyperplasia of the bronchial mucosa all suggest an explanation for the copious mucous secretion of patients with cystic fibrosis. However, it was not possible to ascertain whether these findings reflect a general exocrine defect of such patients or whether they were merely a response to chronic airway infection, even though the latter is a more plausible assumption.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis has been a difficult problem to solve.  One amino acid is not found in elevated concentrations in the urine, one abnormal sugar or polysaccharide is not found in secretions of the bronchial tree which causes pulmonary damage, and a unique material which inhibits sodium transport has not yet been identified in sweat. Instead of viewing the current state of CF research as chaotic, perhaps we should say in a positive way that the diversity of ideas stimulates thinking, and in the process of sorting out the primary defect, a wide spectrum of pathophysiologic changes will be recognized.  Recently a positive-charged polypeptide associated with immunoglobulin G has been identified which may be responsible for the ciliary dyskinesis effect of CF serum.  This material should demonstrate the same properties when bound to immunoglobulin G from control sera.  It would be interesting if it were identical with the basic protein recently found only in the serum and IgG fraction of CF patients and carriers.  Further work may identify how the polypeptide affects cell membrane surfaces, and whether a defective peptidase, perhaps an arginine esterase, fails to break down the polypeptide.  A unifying hypothesis could then emerge and tie biochemical and physiological findings together.\\n',\n",
       " 'To geneticists, cystic fibrosis, perhaps the most frequently encountered genetic disease among Caucasians of European origin, presents an enigmatic dilemma on various levels.  Those problem areas which complicate our understanding of this disease include methods of diagnosis, ascertainment, and analysis and interpretation of data. In spite of an apparently clear-cut mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive), several conceptual difficulties exist in the acceptance of this formal transmission pattern.  The most pressing problem of all, perhaps, is the population genetics of CF.  The fact that a lethal gene may be maintained at such elevated frequencies and restricted to given population groups represents a seemingly genetic paradox.  Our aim is to review some of the problems encountered in a genetic study of CF and to propose a theoretical model which may help in their elucidation.  Topics discussed include problems of diagnosis, ascertainment, and data analysis; family studies and inferences as to the mode of inheritance; population studies; and a proposed model for the inheritance of CF.  The main tenet of this model states that CF is determined by dominant alleles at two autosomal loci, with interaction between them.\\n',\n",
       " 'Because of the prominent role of infection in cystic fibrosis, and because of the genetic nature of both cystic fibrosis and specific immune defects, considerable effort has been expended in determining if there are hereditary immune defects in cystic fibrosis patients that render them susceptible to infection.  Against a congenital immune defect is the fact that the infections nearly always are localized to the lung with the same two organisms, rather than infections at multiple sites involving multiple organisms.  Specific immune mechanisms in the B and T cell systems are examined. Nonspecific host defense mechanisms include the complement system, phagocytosis, pulmonary clearance, the pulmonary barrier to the systemic spread of infection, protease inhibitors, and factor XIII-dependent systems.  Hypersensitivity states include allergy and atopy, allergic aspergillosis, immune complex disease, and hypersensitivity to pancreatic extracts.  The presence or absence of specific antigen components and the association of HL-A antigens are also discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is a disease in which there are enormous and sometimes overwhelming psychological and social problems encountered by the patient and his family.  The present \"state of the art\" as it pertains to the psychological and social aspects of cystic fibrosis are examined.

       " 'The varied morphologic lesions in cystic fibrosis each result from obstruction of one type or another, documented or presumed.  They are modified by the age of the individual, the severity and the conditions peculiar to each tissue.  These lesions, plus the functional changes in sweat electrolytes, membrane transport and serum factor affecting syncrony of cilia, represent the diverse actions of a genetic defect, the intermediate stages of which are as yet unknown.  Neither the diversity of abnormalities, their range in severity, nor differences in the age of onset argue convincingly for a trigger mechanism or acquire rather than inborn deficiency.\\n',\n",
       " 'The general area of research at the biochemical and molecular levels related to cystic fibrosis has suffered from the lack of a suitable animal model.  Although some animal models have been proposed, these have not yet been tested.  In attempts to circumvent this problem several investigators have turned to cell culture techniques to study various aspects of cystic fibrosis.  These studies have included the use of red blood cells, lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts and cultured nasal polyps.  There are enough positive indications from this approach to indicate that it might be fruitful.  Consequently, a final aspect of this article will be a consideration of the use of cell cultures for future investigations into the possible metabolic lesions in cystic fibrosis.  Control of cyclic nucleotide levels in parotid, the role of calcium, microfilaments and microtubules in secretion, and the use of cell cultures as an approach to the study of biochemical defects in cystic fibrosis are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Determination of fibroblast proliferation rates and RNA methylation patterns in our laboratory has revealed no alteration in cells from cystic fibrosis patients.  Blood polyamines are located predominantly in erythrocytes with low concentrations in plasma; sweat has likewise been shown to have a low content of spermidine and spermine.  Whole blood polyamine concentrations fluctuate from one individual to another and are especially variable in females subject to the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle.  Because of the variability in the spermidine and spermine content of blood, it is useful to express such data on the basis of the spermidine/spermine ratio; however, results must be analyzed according to sex and, in the case of females, should be interpreted in relationship to the menstrual cycle.  Spermidine/spermine ratios are significantly elevated in whole blood extracts and isolated erythrocytes from male CF homo- and heterozygotes.\\n',\n",
       " 'Defective mucociliary transport has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the lung disease in cystic fibrosis, based on several observations.  First, patients with the disease secrete more mucus than normal subjects, as indicated by gland hypertrophy, and frequently retain it in the lung.  Second, the mucus is said to have altered biochemical and rheological properties; however, although the physiochemical properties of mucus are altered in all lung diseases, little histochemical or rheological difference has been found in mucus from patients with CF and other hypersecretory conditions such as chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis.  Third, a factor in the serum of CF patients inhibits normal ciliary activity in explain glands of ciliated epithelium; and infection, which damages human ciliated epithelium in culture, could further reduce mucociliary transport.  Measurement of pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis, physical fitness and response to exercise in cystic fibrosis, control of breathing in patients with cystic fibrosis, regional lung function in cystic fibrosis, and therapy of cystic fibrosis are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'This report summarizes selected aspects of pulmonary therapy for cystic fibrosis.  Since the results of chronic bronchopulmonary infection are the cause of death in most CF patients, improved patient survival patterns may possibly be attributed in large part to improvements in antibiotic therapy and increased therapeutic aggressiveness.  Mist tent therapy was defined and initiated in the 1950s, but later studies of mist tent therapy have not shown beneficial response in many patients selected for study. Intermittent aerosol therapy continues to be employed by many physicians to deliver medication rather than bulk liquid to the bronchial mucosa.  Pulmonary endoscopy and lavage, expectorants, allergic aspergillosis, pneumothorax, lobectomy, and hemoptysis are also examined.\\n',\n",
       " 'Early investigators employed histochemical, chemical and physiochemical techniques in an attempt to identify differences between cystic fibrosis and control mucous secretions.  Several mucous glycoprotein abnormalities were suggested by their studies. In retrospect, none of these studies achieved their goal of describing a fundamental mucous glycoprotein abnormality peculiar to CF.  Improved methods have been devised for the collection of mucous glycoproteins in human respiratory tract secretions and the study of their chemical and physical properties.  Therefore, it is now possible to make preliminary comparisons between human tracheobronchial mucous glycoproteins from CF and non-CF sources. General properties of mucous glycoproteins, human tracheobronchial mucous glycoproteins, comparison of CF and non-CF tracheobronchial mucous glycoprotein, and suggested directions for future studies of CF mucous secretions are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is a recessively inherited metabolic disease which is characterized by a universal dysfunction in the exocrine glands of affected individuals.  This dysfunction results in abnormalities of the composition and/or the physiochemical behavior of the various exocrine gland products.  Although significant advances have been made in our understanding of exocrine gland physiology and pharmacology, many questions remain unanswered and significant gaps exist in our knowledge of exocrine gland function.  Perhaps clarification of these issues may lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and to development of better forms of therapy for the patients.  The purpose of this article is to review past and present developments in this area of biomedical research and to point out areas of exocrine gland physiology and pharmacology where more knowledge is needed in order to clarify the nature of a disease like cystic fibrosis.  Composition of the acinar fluid, secretory mechanisms, modification of ductal fluid, ionic dependence and energy requirements of the secretory process, calcium metabolism in exocrine glands, and exocrine gland dysfunction in cystic fibrosis are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'It has been recognized that the levels of water and electrolytes are deranged in many, if not all, of the exocrine secretions of cystic fibrosis patients.  The sodium and chloride levels in serous secretions from CF patients are elevated.  In contrast, the more protein-rich or mucoid, isotonic secretions (viz, from the pancreas and tracheobronchial mucus glands) are found to have sodium concentrations near normal or even somewhat decreased.  However, these secretions have significantly reduced water content.  The abnormalities in hypotonic secretions appear to rise from a decreased Na+ reabsorption in the ducts.  The low water content of the isotonic secretions of CF patients appears to result from decreased secretion of water and electrolytes.  Early studies on tracheobronchial secretions from CF patients led investigators to suggest that the primary defect may be a decrease in the levels of water and monovalent ions.  In an attempt to provide a unifying hypothesis, it has been suggested that an increased calcium concentration in the various exocrine secretions leads to a \"hyperpermeability\" of the mucus linings and thus to an excessive loss of water and small ions. The concentration of calcium in exocrine secretions appears to follow the concentration of proteins and especially the mucous glycoproteins.  It was suggested that calcium may be an important factor in the increased viscosity and insolubility of CF mucus. Organic ions are also potential perturbants of macromolecular structure.  In addition to a possible perturbant role, polyamines have a potential role in water and electrolyte transport.\\n',\n",
       " 'Although complex models involving multiple loci may be plausible, the high frequency of cystic fibrosis in Caucasians is probably best explained by selective advantage for the heterozygote carrier.  In short, an analogy of cystic fibrosis with hemoglobin S sickle cell anemia may be greater than with Tay-Sachs disease in terms of molecular mechanisms.  Protein and polypeptide differences have been reported for the humoral fluids of cystic fibrosis patients and their heterozygotic relatives in connected with selected bioassay systems. These directions relate to a model here proposed for the intermediate stages of the physiology of cystic fibrosis, which builds on a large body of elegant experimental work.  The basic tenet is that the cells of cystic fibrosis heterozygotes and normal individuals are in a stimulatory loop.  Chronic reserpine treatment exaggerates in the normal rat a loop similar to the one exaggerated by genetic differences in the human, elevating to pathological levels an otherwise normal process.\\n',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this paper is to summarize the present state of our knowledge of the gastrointestinal manifestations and absorption and metabolism of nutrients in patients with cystic fibrosis.  The gastrointestinal manifestations include pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, pancreatic calcification and stones, diabetes, liver and gall bladder abnormalities, intestinal obstruction, and complications of malabsorption.  Nutritional aspects of cystic fibrosis include growth retardation and body composition, fat and nitrogen absorption, amino acid absorption, medium-chain triglyceride absorption, and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins.  The critical questions for projection into the future fall into three categories: intestinal absorption, gastrointestinal function and experimental design.\\n',\n",
       " 'A variety of bioassays have identified molecules circulating in cystic fibrosis genotypes and synthesized in vitro by cultured cells from these genotypes by functional disturbances observed in the assays employed.  Preliminary characterizations of these factors are in general agreement and the properties include a small molecular weight polypeptide within the range of 4000 to 10000 MW, a heat-labile protein having a cationic charge, and a protein present in saliva, serum, urine (and perhaps sweat) which is synthesized in vitro by fibroblasts, short-term lymphocytes and long-term lymphoid lines.  The relationship of the factor or factors to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis is presently unknown, but its presence in cystic fibrosis genotypes appears to be related to the basic defect.\\n',\n",
       " 'It has been reported that saliva and serum of patients contain macromolecular \"factors\" which are presumably cationic and inhibit transport of electrolytes, induce dyskinesis or degranulate sensitized polymorphonuclear leukocytes and contain polypeptide moieties.  The difference between levels of trypsin-like activity of mixed saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis and controls has been confirmed.  A number of studies have been carried out in order to determine if a deficiency of proteolytic activity might account for the presence of cystic fibrosis serum factors.  It was presumed that the observed partial deficiency of arginine esterase activity might well represent the total deficiency of one of several arginine esterases assayed under the experimental conditions.  Although it was postulated that the deficiency of arginine esterase activity is related to the elevation of the levels of polypeptide or protein \"factors\", the hydrolysis of peptide bands by activated plasma could not be demonstrated, probably due to the limitations of the methods employed.  The deficiency of plasma arginine esterase in cystic fibrosis has been questioned and confirmed in another laboratory.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cor pulmonale was defined by a committee of the World Health Organization as \"right ventricular hypertrophy, secondary to disease of the lung parenchyma or pulmonary vasculature, or due to abnormalities of pulmonary function.\"  It has been estimated that 70% of children dying with cystic fibrosis have cor pulmonale, though as children live longer, the number may be higher.  Clinical diagnosis, management, prognosis, echocardiography, echocardiography as a measure of left ventricular dysfunction, and a study of 94 ambulatory and hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients are discussed.  The study establishes that in patients with cystic fibrosis, left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy occur and are related to increasing severity of pulmonary involvement.\\n',\n",
       " 'The interactions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with humoral factors in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis were investigated by using an indirect immunofluorescent technique. Fluorescein- conjugated, monovalent antiserum specific to heavy chains of human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM and to complement C3 were used. All strains of P. aeruginosa recovered from the sputum specimens of patients with cystic fibrosis were found to be coated with antibodies of IgA, IgG, and IgM classes and with C3. The specificity of the antibody coating was determined. The fluorescence was most intense with IgA and was followed in intensity by IgG, IgM, and C3. No difference was noted between rough and mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa. When the subcultured P. aeruginosa was incubated with the sputum eluates, a similar pattern of fluorescence was demonstrated, indicating that these humoral factors are present in the sputum and that the coating process can take place in the lower respiratory tract of the patients. By single radial immunodiffusion, significant quantities of the humoral factors in the sputum eluates were detected. These findings suggest that P. aeruginosa is opsonized in sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

The assessments were performed to provide a rigorous test of the popular hypothesis that chronically ill children are especially vulnerable to psychopatholgy. In contrast to this sterotype, results across measures demonstrated the normalcy rather than the deviance of these children. Although exceptions were noted, the children's functional strengths and coping abilities noticeably outweighed their weaknesses.\\n\",\n",

       " 'A key to any successful preventive nutritional program is long-term follow up, reinforcement, and early intervention when necessary.  The dietitian must evaluate the effectiveness of her approach through careful monitoring of various parameters of growth, such as length, weight, head circumference, and skinfold measurements.  It is essential that she be aware of the advantages, limitations, and complications of any dietary program.  We have described only three examples of complex nutritional problems encountered in the intensive care nursery.  There are many more equally challenging and frustrating medical and surgical disorders which demand the expertise of the dietitian for successful management.  The dietitian of the future cannot rely on knowledge alone, but must utilize considerable ingenuity and creativity in managing these complicated nutritional enigmas if acceptance and effectiveness are to be maintained.\\n',\n",
       " 'The present communication reports the effect of the bacterial mucus on the activity of antibodies on strains of P. aeruginosa.  Mucoid variants of P. aeruginosa obtained from the non-mucoid strains PAO 381 and PAT 404 by selection for phenotypic resistance to the virulent phage E 79 were more resistant to carbenicillin than the non-mucoid parent strains.  Mucoid P. aeruginosa strains isolated from two CF patients were more resistant to carbenicillin than non-mucoid strains isolated from the same samples of sputum.  When the experiments already described were repeated with oxytetracycline, in contrast to our experience with carbenicillin, mucoid strains were found to be more sensitive than non-mucoid strains.  To prove the hypothesis that mucoid strains can be selected in vivo by carbenicillin therapy it will be necessary to show that the level of carbenicillin in CF secretions is less than the minimum inhibitory concentrations of mucoid strains but greater than that of non-mucoid strains.  We are now investigating additional CF isolates in conjunction with the range of antibiotics used in chemotherapy of CF patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Great Britain, Central Europe and North America and it affects 1 in 2000 live born children.  Does the antibiotic treatment in cystic fibrosis differ from the treatment of respiratory infection in other conditions?  The cystic fibrosis patient not only suffers progressive deterioration in respiratory function; he often has dangerous complicating conditions culminating in super-infection by highly resistant organisms.  The basic principle of antibiotic therapy must be rigidly applied in cystic fibrosis.  The first principle is to identify the pathogen and its susceptibility to antibiotics.  The second principle is to ensure that the chosen antibiotic reaches the site of infection.  The third principle is that the antibiotic therapy ought to complement the immunological defences of the patient.  A fourth principle is that no therapy must be given without first deciding upon the criteria which will be acceptable as indicating clinical improvement.\\n',\n",
       " 'Although similar fractions of cells were in the S phase of the cell cycle, normal human skin fibroblasts were shown to incorporate more than twice the 3HTdR into their DNA in vitro than did cells obtained from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Obligate heterozygotes incorporated an intermediate amount of the DNA precursor. Studied were initiated to determine the basis of the differential incorporation of 3HTdR among the genotypes. An analog of thymidine, BUdR, produced varied effects on the growth kinetics of the three genotypes. The growth of cells in BUdR resulted in a 50% increase in the population doubling times of all three genotypes, and caused the cell morphology to change from a spindle shape to one in which the cells became broadened and flat, with numerous cytoplasmic projections extending for distances of several cell diameters. The activities of thymidine kinase and the participation of the exogenous and de novo pathways in the synthesis of TMP were found to be approximately the same in all three genotypes. The data suggest that an alteration in the transport of thymidine into the cells may account for the differences in TdR incorporation into DNA, and this may be associated with other changes in cystic fibrosis that are apparently membrane associated.\\n',\n",

       " 'Amantadine-HC1, an antiviral drug clinically effective against most strains of influenza A virus, was evaluated in a double-blind trial in 153 children with cystic fibrosis during the initial appearance of influenza A/England/42 virus in the New England area. Infection with this variant strain of influenza virus did not reach epidemic proportions during the study, so that the effectiveness of amantadine in this study population could not be fully assessed. However, the potential symptomatic and biochemical toxicity of amantadine was carefully monitored in a pediatric population. Serologic screening by complement fixation tests indicated that respiratory viruses may be important pathogens in exacerbations of respiratory disease in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'The effectiveness and safety of tobramycin against infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis were studied in 15 patients with moderate-to-severe exacerbation of chronic pulmonary infection. Seventeen courses of treatment were given. Tobramycin (5-7.5 mg/kg per day) was administered intravenously in three divided doses per day (seven to 21 days). All specimens of sputum yielded moderate-to-heavy growth of P. aeruginosa; all isolates were inhibited by 4 mug of tobramycin/ml, and in seven cases isolates were not inhibited by 4 mug of gentamicin/ml. The mean levels of tobramycin in the blood were 4.4 mug/ml 0.5-1 hr and 0.8 mug/ml 7.5-8 hr after administration. All patients received an antistaphylococcal agent before, during, and after therapy. All patients except for two received 750 mg of carbenicillin/kg per day intravenously in six divided doses and 1 g of carbenicillin in a mask for inhalation three times a day. Both clinical and radiological improvement was noted in all patients. The white blood cell count, which was elevated in seven patients, returned to normal, and levels of blood gases improved. P. aeruginosa was eliminated from the sputum in five cases. No adverse side effects were noted.\\n',\n",
       " 'Established respiratory infections with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis were treated with conventional as well as larger doses of tobramycin. The infection was eradicated in four of the 17 patients treated, but the duration of follow-up study of one patient was short. It appeared that treatment was most successful in those patients in whom the highest peak concentrations of tobramycin in sputum were obtained. No side effects were noted, even when tobramycin was given in large doses for two weeks.\\n',\n",
       " 'Patients who had cystic fibrosis and acute infectious exacerbations of pulmonary disease produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated with a combination of tobramycin and ticarcillin. P. aeruginosa recovered from patients was inhibited by lower concentrations of both of these drugs than of gentamicin or carbenicillin. Thirteen courses of treatment were administered to 11 patients (mean, 14.4 days). A favorable response was seen in 11 of 12 completed courses of treatment. Improvement was associated with decreases in white blood cell count, temperature, and sedimentation rate. Adverse reactions were uncommon. Although P. aeruginosa was not eradicated from the sputum, the clinical results suggest that the combination of tobramycin and ticarcillin may be particularly useful for treatment of acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease in patients with cystic fibrosis from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.\\n',\n",

       " 'The amylase in sera of 20 patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CFP), 17 of whom had pancreatic insufficiency (PI), and of 34 normal control subjects was separated into its pancreatic and salivary components and quantitated. Electrophoretic separation was achieved on polyacrylamide disc gels with subsequent sectioning of the gel columns. The amylase content in international units per liter (IU/L.) was obtained for each section by the insoluble blue starch substrate method. The mean total serum amylase of the CFP patients with PI was significantly lower than the control group. A highly significant decrease was found when the pancreatic isoamylase was considered alone. The salivary isoamylase level remained essentially the same. Three patients with CFP but without PI demonstrated higher than normal pancreatic amylase values in the serum. These patients may be in an early stage of a progressive involvement of the pancreas in which there is an increased release of amylase. This method of electrophoretic separation and quantitation of the serum amylase is sensitive and efficient and allows the simultaneous processing of multiple specimens. The results obtained agree with previously published ratios of serum isoamylases. Our method should be valuable in the study of other diseases of the exocrine pancreas and salivary glands.\\n',\n",
       " 'In cystic fibrosis there is chronic infection and inflammatory reaction in the airways, accompanied by destruction and shedding of airway epithelium. Leukocytes migrate into the airways and some disintegrate, liberating deoxyribonucleoprotein that is incorporated into the gel structure of the bronchial mucus. We compared the status of these processes in cystic fibrosis with that in chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, by examining the sputum raised from the lower airways. Measurements also were made on sputum induced in normal subjects. The results indicate that migration of leukocytes into the airways and shedding of damaged airway epithelium were minimal in the normal subjects; they were significant in the patients with chronic bronchitis, higher in those with bronchiectasis, and still higher in those with cystic fibrosis. The large increases found in the total content of DNA and solids in the cystic fibrosis sputum were due to increases in the insoluble fraction containing the whole leukocytes and particulate debris that remained when the sputum mucus gel was solubilized with mercaptoethanol. Despite the large increases in the total content of DNA and solids, the contents of mucus gel components and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegrated leukocytes actually present in the mucus gel structure of the cystic fibrosis sputum were not significantly higher than in the sputum from the patients with chronic bronchitis or brochiectasis.\\n',\n",

Values were significantly reduced in the three determinations in patients with gluten-induced enteropathy as compared to control subjects. Lactase and L-ALA-L-Phe hydrolase activities were significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) in CF patients as compared to control subjects. Definite hypolactasia was also observed in 23% of the children with CF. Uptake of lysine was normal in CF patients whereas that of phenylalanine and cycloleucine was reduced as compared to control subjects.

Guidelines for the physician treating these young adults and their families include: (1) encouragement for greater involvement by the patient's father; (2) assisting the mother to find outside interests and to allow more independence to the patient; (3) stressing communication about cystic fibrosis within the home; (4) emphasizing outside activity for each patient; (5) repeated discussions of the patient's concerns while emphasizing his strengths; (6) anticipation of problems, specific to cystic fibrosis, such as sterility in males; and (7) encouragement of interpatient communication.\\n\",\n",

Clinical discussion argues that this child had acquired coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency and that this was secondary to the fat malabsorption that occurs in cystic fibrosis.  The left third nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis in a patient with rapid neurologic deterioration suggest a mass lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere with uncal herniation. Pathologic discussion also suggests intracranial hemorrhage, massive on left, accompanied by cystic fibrosis with severe pancreatic lesions and bleeding disorder, probably due to vitamin K deficiency.\\n',\n",

For example, only 4 of 468 cultures from skin, throat, and nares of the family members were positive for P. aeruginosa. Isolations of P. aeruginosa from the same CF patients were often of the same pyocine type. No specific pyocine type of P. aeruginosa was predominant in patients with CF. Isolations of P. aeruginosa from siblings with CF may or may not be of the same pyocine type as that of the family proband.

He has no symptoms of cystic fibrosis.  The determination of sodium and chloride ions in the sweat excluded homozygosity; the bromide test led us to conclude the child to be a heterozygote.  In our patient the protein content of the meconium, the majority of which was albumin, was two- to threefold that of the controls.  This elevated protein content, however, was not characteristic of homozygosity.  Our results lead us to conclude that a high protein content of meconium does not unconditionally indicate the homozygotic state for cystic fibrosis.  It would appear that heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis is not completely without abnormality.  Our findings perhaps explain \"false positive\" results recorded in the literature.  High-protein content in the meconium may be useful in the identification of heterozygotes too.\\n',\n",

This study was undertaken to compare the concentrations of sodium and chloride in whole body sweat of normal control patients and of CF patients obtained by thermal stimulation with samples collected locally by pilocarpine iontophoresis.  Electrolyte concentrations in whole body sweat samples correlated in a highly significant fashion with sodium and chloride values found in arm patch sweat.  Patients with CF, however, showed significantly higher sodium and chloride concentrations in arm patch sweat and whole body sweat, and increased sodium excretion rates.\\n',\n",

Of 45 patients diagnosed prior to extensive irreversible pulmonary involvement, only one has died and none is disabled. In contrast, of the other 50 patients diagnosed after substantial irreversible pulmonary disease was present, 26 have died. Mortality and morbidity has been greater in females. Possible factors contributing to the improving prognosis include early diagnosis, aggressive management with comprehensive care, easy access to specialized care, and improved antimicrobial therapy.\\n',\n",

There was an unusually high incidence of meconium ileus equivalent (35%). Three infant siblings of patients in this study had died of cystic fibrosis prior to referral of a family member to this center. One patient died at age four years after emotional problems interfered with the treatment program; status asthmaticus played a major role in his terminal respiratory failure. The remainder of the patients have had substantially less morbidity from pulmonary disease than a comparable, much larger group of white patients. Only one patient, age 28, who is married and employed full-time has severe pulmonary involvement as assessed by pulmonary function studies and chest roentgenogram. The 16 surviving patients have a mean age of 13 1/2 years after a mean follow-up period of 10 years. If black patients with cystic fibrosis survive infancy, they then, as a group, may have a relatively good prognosis.\\n',\n",

The large number of abdominal situations in CF which can cause pain confused with but not typical of acute appendicitis. The true underlying condition is further masked by the concurrent use of antibiotics for pulmonary infection. A higher index of suspicion is needed to rule out acute appendicitis in a patient with cystic fibrosis and abdominal pain.

At risk screening is the carrying out of such a test or procedure on a person or persons for whom there already exists some medical reason to suppose that the findings may be positive.  This review of conditions for which population screening may be considered is not exhaustive, but it serves to show the central dilemma in this field, which is that, apart from congenital dislocation of the hip, phenylketonuria and possibly homocystinuria, none seems to show quite strong enough a case to be considered worthwhile screening for on its own.\\n',\n",

The absence of other typical features of cystic fibrosis confused the diagnosis. Recovery of mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa from sputum cultures helped to establish the diagnosis in these patients, because these mucoid isolates are rarely obtained from subjects who do not have cystic fibrosis. Recent findings, which have identified the mucoid isolates as predominantly a single strain of P aeruginosa and have documented its widespread carriage in the United States by patients with cystic fibrosis, point to an interesting epidemiologic relationship between this bacterium and this disease.\\n',\n",

       " 'The effects of serum from children with cystic fibrosis and from normal children on the mucus-secreting, ciliated epithelium have been investigated in vitro using explanted tissue from rabbit lung. By optical and scanning electron microscopy, a sequence of structural changes is observed after incubation with cystic fibrosis serum; this sequence does not occur with normal serum. The earliest changes involve swelling of the goblet cells, with subsequent discharge of mucus onto the epithelial surface. This is followed by disruption of the normally rapid and synchronized ciliary activity. Mucus gradually extends over the surface entangling cilia. Finally, some shedding of ciliated cells occurs from the epithelium. These findings suggest that factors in cystic fibrosis serum cause discharge of mucus leading to a disturbance of the normal ciliary activity in the rabbit lung. It is postulated that such changes result in dysfunction of the mucociliary clearance mechanism and that this dysfunction may be a contributory factor to the pathogenesis of lung disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Screening for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in the newborn has been in vogue since the introduction of a rapid simple test based in the presence of albumin in the meconium of C.F. babies.  False-positive tests have been observed in prematurity or when the specimen is contaminated with blood.  We have reduced the number of false positives by additional studies on the meconium, including detection of lactase. Lactase activity can be detected in meconium from babies with C.F. but not in meconium for healthy babies.  In testing 200 normal meconiums with a negative albumin test we noted 3 positive tests for lactase.  These 3 patients did not have C.F.  These false-positive lactase tests could be distinguished by the addition of distilled water to the meconium instead of lactose.  This simple test may provide an additional or alternative method for detection of C.F. in a screening programme.  When this test is used in addition to the albumin test the number of false-positive albumin tests will be reduced.\\n',\n",
       " 'Two reviews have questioned the value of meconium tests for the routine screening of cystic fibrosis because of the high proportion of false-positive and (perhaps more importantly) false-negative results.  We wish to report our findings on false-negative results. We are evaluating various methods of meconium screening including the Boehringer Mannheim test strip, a semiquantitative test for proteins, electroimmunoassay of albumin, and estimation of the albumin/alpha1-antirypsin ratio.  The figures are too small to draw any conclusions between the apparent relationship of false-negative results and a family history of the disease, but we feel that the results illustrate that little reliance should be put on a negative meconium test.  This is not to say that the meconium test is valueless.  In our study, at least 40% of infants with cystic fibrosis had a positive meconium-test result but did not have meconium ileus and thus the possibility of cystic fibrosis in these infants was recognised within a few days after birth and usually well before definitive clinical signs of the disease were manifest.\\n',\n",
       " 'In an effort to determine whether increased permeability to calcium ions could explain the cystic fibrosis-serum ciliary dyskensia factor response in the tracheal test system, we selectively increased the membrane permeability of the tracheal epithelium to calcium ions by adding calcium ionophore A23187 to the tracheal culture medium. These studies determined that calcium ionophore A23187 in culture medium produced a change in mucociliary function in the tracheal test system indistinguishable from that promoted by C.F. sera.  These investigations, which are now being extended to include the ultrastructural alterations induced in the epithelium of the rabbit tracheal bioassay system, point to an important role for calcium as a cofactor in the production of the C.D.F. response generated by the C.F sera.  The C.F. serum substance seems to act at the cellular-membrane level, promoting membrane-permeability changes (at least with respect to calcium) in the rabbit tracheal test system. Such a mechanism would not necessarily result in a net physiological imbalance of calcium in the rabbit tracheal system but only local changes in calcium concentration that would subsequently alter secretion and microtubular function.  Since C.F. serum, like sweat and saliva from these same patients, can promote ionic fluxes, perhaps there is a common factor in all these body-fluids which is related to the basic defect in C.F.  It is tempting to speculate that such a factor produces a membrane-associated phenomenon that may be generally representative of the in-vivo C.F. disorder and as such may reflect the nature of the cellular and glandular abnormalities of the disease.\\n',\n",

The profile and hyponychial angles were both found to be good discriminators of clubbing and to be independent of age and sex. The normal profile angle was 168.3 degrees +/- 3.6 and the mean normal hyponychial angle was 180.1 degrees +/- 4.2. Patients with cystic fibrosis and cyanotic congenital heart-disease were found to have grossly elevated values of these angles. Some asthmatics were found to have a moderate degree of clubbing with significantly elevated values of these angles. The shadowgram proved a convenient objective method for recording the degree and progress of fingerclubbing in clinical practice.\\n',\n",

Research directions in cystic fibrosis have evolved from observations of the characteristic malfunctions inherent in the disease.  These include defects in mucociliary function, mucous secretion, membrane transport and glycoprotein biosynthesis. Drawing from what is known about the bases of other inherited diseases, one could predict that cystic fibrosis results from an abnormal functional protein, as in sickle cell anemia; an enzyme deficiency, as in phenylketonuria; or a deficiency of a normal inhibitor, as in hereditary angioedema.\\n',\n",

Two other observations merit mention.  First, the demonstration by Magos of the existence of a factor in CF sweat which interfered with reabsorption of sodium in the rat parotid.  Secondly is the existence of a CF serum component which interfered with ciliary rhythm in organ culture systems.  Our investigations in cystic fibrosis have been oriented towards the establishment of a possible pedigree of causes which will unite all these observations and secondly to develop a possible method for heterozygote detection.  Cystic fibrosis RNA is relatively undermethylated in comparison with contrast cultures.  In addition, CF heterozygote fibroblast cultures also appear undermethylated.  Our interpretation of these data do not imply a primary defect of RNA methylases in cystic fibrosis but rather suggested a defect elsewhere in biochemical sequences involving methionine.\\n',\n",

A detailed comparison of 5 CF and 5 control strains showed that the CF cells synthesized 3 times more intracellular cyclic AMP than controls.  In this paper, we present data on an additional 10 CF and 10 control strains. Measurement of intracellular cyclic AMP did not provide the same clear-cut differences between the CF and control strains, as we had previously observed.  The CF strains synthesized more cyclic AMP than controls but the difference was not as large as in our earlier study and there is considerable overlap between the two groups.  It is not clear why these two studies should have yielded such disparate results.\\n',\n",

The mucins studied in the present work were obtained from the insoluble and fibrillar part of sputum.  If bronchial mucins are the main glycoproteins in the fibrillar mucus, these data suggest that there is a high proportion of acidic mucins within the bronchial secretions from CF patients. The predominance of acidic mucins may not be a specific feature of CF since the sputum from the 2 patients with other diseases had a similar mucin distribution.  As far as CF is concerned, it is presently impossible to state whether the bronchial mucins represent normal mucins of the child or structurally abnormal molecules.\\n',\n",

Biochemical studies on bronchial secretions have not yet confirmed any qualitative difference in composition or in the nature of the glycoproteins, the major component of secretion.  With the lack of any clear evidence of a basic abnormality in the nature of mucus, attention has been directed to the possible defect in the control of mucus secretion. This encompasses alteration in the normal regulation of the autonomic nervous system or to its stimulation either at the cellular or intracellular control level.  In recent years, attention has focused on the presence of ciliotoxic factors in serum of children with cystic fibrosis, and their possible role in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis.  Control of mucus secretion, submucosal glands, goblet cells, experimental models of lung disease in cystic fibrosis, the role of serum factors in mucus secretion, and the mucus blanket in chronic lung disease are discussed.\\n',\n",

This review will draw in large measure on the experience of Prof. L.

The chemistry of glycoproteins, carbohydrate to amino acid linkages, carbohydrate structural analysis, biosynthesis, and regulation are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Over the past few years, studies from various laboratories have suggested the presence of a factor(s) in cystic fibrosis serum causing widespread in vitro abnormalities of components of the lung defence mechanism particularly with respect to macrophage dysfunction, quantitative and qualitative alterations in mucus, and ciliary motility.  The possible in vivo role of ciliary dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the disease is of particular clinical interest.  Since an in vitro ciliary dyskinesia factor had been previously demonstrated and pulmonary complications are the hallmark of CF, yet clearance in most of our clinically stable CF subjects was relatively well maintained, this suggested to us that a mucociliary transport abnormality might be present intermittently.  In order to explore this further, we designed nasal mucociliary clearance studies to determine whether CF serum might exhibit MCT inhibition in vivo. From these studies, we concluded that there was a substance(s) in CF serum which had the capacity to slow MCT.  Whether this effect is on the cilia themselves or via overproduction of normal or abnormal mucus is not known.\\n',\n",
       " 'If we are to fully understand the factors which control mucociliary clearance throughout the human lung and the interrelationships between clearance and disease, it will be necessary to measure mucociliary clearance rates in airways at all levels within the lung. During the past few years, technical means have been sought whereby the rates of mucus clearance within individual airways can be measured.  In this laboratory, we have developed a relatively noninvasive technique for measuring mucociliary tracheal transport rates.  We measured MTTRs in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis.  The MTTRs did not correlate well with the degree of pulmonary disease in these patients.  The measurements of MTTR would suggest that a deranged mucociliary clearance mechanism is not a necessary condition for patients with CF.  We have also been interested in evaluating the effectiveness of the therapy used in the treatment of CF.\\n',\n",

It has been generally accepted that cystic fibrosis follows simple autosomal recessive transmission.  It is difficult, however, to explain maintenance of a lethal gene at such high frequency.  Nothing is known of the chromosomal localization of the trait.  At present there is no simple and reliable method of heterozygote detection.  The secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis are often not copious but exhibit a peculiar rheologic property.  Several groups have emphasized decreased water content of cystic fibrosis secretions in the pathogenesis of the disease.  There is no consistent abnormality of glycoproteins or glycosaminoglycans to explain why mucus secretions precipitate and obstruct the organ passages.\\n',\n",

Although not fulfilling the hopes of a quick route to discovery of the basic defect in this disease that were raised by the first findings, the study of fibroblasts in cystic fibrosis has given important information.  The evidence at present indicates that lysosomes and probably other intracellular organelles are normal in morphology and function in cystic fibrosis.  Several humoral abnormalities have been found in cystic fibrosis: those that influence ciliary activity in experimental models; those that affect membrane transport; and the abnormality in polyamine distribution. A number of abnormal humoral factors have been found in cystic fibrosis.  The limitations in their interpretation are serious: the assays used to delineate these abnormalities are often not universally reproducible, some because of their inherent variability and others because they are technically forbidding.  Therefore, unified definition of the so-called \"cystic fibrosis factors\" is not possible at present.\\n',\n",
       " 'Recent autonomic nervous system studies in cystic fibrosis are outlined.  Miscellaneous observations regarding salivary and tear glands, calcium, the kallikrein-kinin system, protease inhibitor, alpha-fetoprotein, and endocrine glands are discussed.  Because more than 90 per cent of patients with cystic fibrosis die of progressive pulmonary involvement, complicated by infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (or both), the question of immunologic deficit is frequently raised.  Extensive investigations have shown the immune system in cystic fibrosis to be intact. Studies regarding pulmonary ciliary clearance and bacteriology are also outlined.  Despite extensive investigations, the basic defect of cystic fibrosis is still unknown.  What then is the explanation of the two defects in homozygotes that lead to most clinical manifestations - the sweat electrolyte defect and the abnormality in physiochemical behavior of mucous secretions?  The former is satisfactorily explained by a sodium-reabsorption-inhibitory factor present in sweat and saliva of patients.  As for the mucous-secretion abnormality, the effect of the increasing calcium concentration in decreasing the solubility of glycoproteins suggests that this mechanism might be responsible for the precipitation and obstruction of organ passages, which gives rise to most symptoms in cystic fibrosis.  Although there is an excellent diagnostic test for homozygotes (sweat test), one cannot rely on any of the present biologic assays for determination of heterozygosity or antenatal diagnosis.\\n',\n",
       " \"Dysuria, uric acid crystalluria and hyperuricosuria developed in a child with cystic fibrosis and normal serum uric acid. Hyperuricosuria in this patient and two other children was directly related to ingestion of large amounts of pancreatic extract. In these three children, reducing pancreatic extract dosage by 85 percent lowered their purine intake by 307, 225, and 148 mg, respectively; urinary uric acid excretion decreased by 245, 239, and 158 mg. Overmedication resulted from parents' decisions to increase enzyme dosages. In our cystic fibrosis clinic, 15 of 32 patients screened at random were taking higher than the prescribed dose of pancreatic enzymes, and 14 of these 15 children were hyperuricosuric. On the basis of this information, we suggest that the minimal effective dose of pancreatic extract should be determined and adhered to for each child with cystic fibrosis to avoid potential renal injury from hyperuricosuria.\\n\",\n",

The risks of producing a child with cystic fibrosis in Table 1 would have been essentially correct if they had been stated in fractional terms.  They are, however, stated in odds forms, and therefore understatements of the true risks.  The risk when both parents are known to be heterozygous, for example, is stated as 1:4. This would mean that the second alternative has four times as much likelihood of occurring as the first, and it is clearly not true. When both parents are heterozygous the odds are three times as likely that the child will be normal as affected.  This is usually stated as a risk of 1/4, or 1:3, that the child will be affected.\\n',\n",
       " 'Our recent studies showed normal serum thyroxine but lower serum total and free tri-iodothyronine and higher serum thyrotropin concentration in children with cystic fibrosis than in controls matched for age and sex.  Furthermore, administration of iodides to children with cystic fibrosis resulted in goiter decrease in serum thyroxine and increase in serum thyrotropin concentration.  Our studies point to multiple derangement in thyroid hormone economy in children with cystic fibrosis.  Peripheral deiodination of thyroxine to tri-iodothyronine may be defective, probably as a result of a state of malnutrition.  An intrinsic abnormality may also be present in the thyroid gland.  Iodide, which is frequently used in this disease, may enhance this defect, occasionally producing hypothyroidism.  Therefore, the thyroid, like other organs of endodermal origin (lung and pancreas), may be involved in cystic fibrosis.  Thyroid function should be examined in all children with cystic fibrosis, and if iodides are administered, replacement doses of thyroid hormones should also be given to prevent hypothyroidism. - A recent review of cystic fibrosis referred to the report by Chandra et al. that the serum level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or heterozygotes who bear the CF gene.  The report of Chandra et al. had prompted us to assess the level of AFP in cystic fibrosis, and we wish to record here briefly our negative observations.  On the whole, these results suggest that AFP is not increased in cystic fibrosis. - We thought that the complications of therapy with iodides or other agents was beyond the scope of our review, and thus we did not discuss the very interesting observations of the high rate of goiter after iodide therapy in CF patients.  Whether this phenomenon indicates a subclinical thyroid defect related to CF per se or is a secondary effect of chronic illness in youth is still unsettled.\\n',\n",

Kappa type IgM and IgG was not present in serum and external secretions; gamma, mu and lambda chains were probably polyclonal in character. Antibodies against kappa chains were not detected in either the patient or the mother. Plasma cells containing kappa-type immunoglobulins were absent in jejunum samples and bone marrow; kappa-chainbearing B lymphocytes could not be detected in blood and bone marrow. The serum of one of the patient's sisters contained trace amounts of kappa-type immunoglobulins.

Of fundamental importance is the way in which the airways and lung parenchyma prevent entry of and neutralize or remove injurious agents, tasks performed so efficiently that the lung is normally sterile from the first bronchial division to terminal lung units.  Inhaled particles may be deposited in the respiratory tract as a result of impaction, sedimentation, Brownian motion, turbulent diffusion, and, to a minimal degree, electrostatic forces.  Particles deposited between the posterior two thirds of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx and from the larynx to the terminal bronchioles land on airways lined by mucus-covered, ciliated epithelium and are removed by means of mucociliary transport mechanisms.

       " 'The potential usefulness of analysis of the salivary secretions in diagnosis and prognosis is beginning to be explored in depth. The preliminary work already undertaken indicates that modern methods applied to this secretion may provide information that is different from that obtained in other body fluids. Saliva is collected at the point of its manufacture and, therefore, is unaffected by collection or storage in the body. It is the product both of protein synthesis within the glands and of most of the known water and electrolyte exchange mechanisms. Salivary composition is affected by both autonomic and hormonal stimuli. As the specific influence of each of these factors is better understood, studies of this fluid will provide important clues to the understanding of disease and the evaluation of therapy. There are few places in the body where it is possible directly, utilizing a non-invasive technique, to examine the product of a large number of important biological processes. It is obvious that careful handling of collection and analytic techniques are essential if these secretions are to be utilized. Future investigations in clinical situations should take full advantage of the strong base of knowledge of the physiology of these glands. Development of this field depends on careful clinical investigations designed to make full use of our current knowledge.\\n',\n",
       " 'The Golgi complex has an important role in the regulation and normal development of the cell, contributing to anabolic functions including the assembly and secretion of macromolecules and to catabolic functions, in the synthesis of lysosomes.  The central role of the Golgi complex in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins has been demonstrated.  The purpose of this review is to focus attention on the structural and functional correlation of the Golgi complex in the liver, in relation to its involvement in disease.  The hepatic parenchymal cell has been used widely as a model to study biosynthetic, absorptive and secretory functions of epithelial cell types.  The studies are grouped under five broad headings: structural organization; development and differentiation; ultrastructural changes in pathologic conditions; alterations in glycoprotein biosynthesis; and alterations in glycosyltransferases.\\n',\n",
       " 'This article provides evidence that opportunistic infection can be expected in chronically debilitated, immunosuppressed persons.  The onset of an infectious disease in these patients can be sudden or insidious with few prodromal signs.  Anorexia, malaise, fever, and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms that these children may manifest because of their primary illness or its treatment.  Any insult to natural defense barriers may cause serious infections in the compromised host.  An infected wound from an insect bite, easily controlled by local measures in a healthy person, may become a focus for septicemia in a child with leukemia.  Despite the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the specific infection, the immunosuppressed person is still subject to overwhelming infection by resistant opportunistic organisms until the natural defense mechanisms are restored.  An awareness of the vulnerability of the compromised host is the key to effective diagnosis and management of the various complications of infectious disease.\\n',\n",

       " 'The early clinical recognition and assessment of cor pulmonale are frequently difficult. To evaluate the usefulness of echocardiographic measurement of right ventricular dimension and septal motion in assessing cor pulmonale, we studied 94 patients with cystic fibrosis of varying severity. There was a significant relationship between increasing right ventricular dimension index (RVDI) and (1) decreasing clinical score, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMFR); and (2) increasing residual volume and thoracic gas volume. There was no correlation between right ventricular dimension index and PaO2. These findings were supported by electrocardiogram and pathologic evidence of right ventricular involvement. Abnormal septal motion was observed more frequently in patients with severe obstructive airway disease as measured by decreased vital capacity, FEV1, and MMFR. The data show that there is echocardiographic evidence of mild right ventricular enlargement and/or hypertrophy much earlier in the course of cystic fibrosis than previously suspected and that the echocardiogram is a useful tool in the evaluation of cor pulmonale in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Centrifuged pellets of turbid parotid saliva from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and non-CF subjects, obtained from saliva kept at 2 degrees for 10 min, had the electron microscope appearance of amorphous, round particles, and were thought to be colloidal aggregates of organic material. Drops of turbid saliva, from samples incubated for 2 hr at 2 degrees or 37 degrees, additionally contained discrete, electron-dense crystals having well defined angular morphology: usually cubic, retangular, or approximately hexagonal. The inhibitors, urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and EDTA, resulted in no crystals being observed. Selected area electron diffraction from individual crystals showed predominantly hexagonal, rectangular patterns could be indexed as coming from hydroxyapitite. A transition from the hexagonal to the rectangular pattern and back to the hexagonal pattern could be obtained from individual crystals tilted in the electron microscope. The square diffraction pattern may be from octa-calcium or brushite. Polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis of the parotid saliva indicated that the sparingly soluble proteins in the 2 degree and 37 degree pellets comprised proline-rich proteins and a calcium-precipitable, trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable phosphoprotein, which fluoresced with amido schwarz and Coomassie brilliant blue G250.\\n',\n",
       " 'The present study using immunologic methodology confirms previous observations from this laboratory of an absence of a protease component with arginine esterase activity in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. In this study, the pooled plasma from control individuals was activated and partially purified after adsorption on columns of soybean trypsin inhibitor conjugated to Sepharose 4B followed by elution with benzamidine. The fraction was further purified by isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels. Proteins around the pI range of 5.5 were eluted and utilized to prepare an antiserum. Immunoelectrophoresis of activated plasma samples from control subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis was performed utilizing the antiserum. In controls, four precipitin arcs with residual esterase activity were observed, whereas only three were seen in plasma from patients with cystic fibrosis. Double gel diffusion experiments using specific antisera ruled out the presence of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasminogen, prothrombin, C1 esterase, alpha one-trypsin inhibitor, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor in the concentrated benzamidine eluate. The antisera to alpha two- macroglobulin gave an immunoprecipitate which was readily stained for proteolytic activity. On immunoelectrophoresis, the alpha two- macroglobulin precipitin band corresponded to the band absent in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. In contrast, the alpha two- macroglobulin levels were similar in plasma of control subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis. Using the antiserum to the protein fractith proteolytic activity could be demonstrated in control plasma. One specific enzyme-active \"rocket\" was absent in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. In a double blind study of 15 control samples and 15 samples from patients with cystic fibrosis, a specific \"rocket\" was shown to be present in 13 control samples and absent in 14 cystic fibrosis samples. alpha two-Macroglobulin was determined by both an immunologic procedure and by its trypsin binding (trypsin protein esterase concentration). The ratio of the immunologic assay to the biologic activity assay was 90 for the normal plasma samples and only 65 for cystic fibrosis samples.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sections of pancreas from 16 individuals who died with cystic fibrosis (CF) were classified by morphometric criteria into four categories in increasing order of pancreatic involvement. The concentration of acini, islets, main ducts, lobular ducts, connective tissue, and fat was compared with control levels. The results show that in the least involved pancreases, from neonates who died under 5 months of age, acini were reduced to 33% of control levels and the following were increased: islets, to 410%, lobular ducts, to 250%; and main ducts, to 1700% of controls. With increasing severity of the pancreatic disease the acini were further reduced to 5% and lobular ducts to 37% of control levels, respectively. Main ducts increased by 19-fold, and fatty infiltration accounted for more than 25% of the fresh weight of the pancreas in 9 of the 16 specimens. Comparative biochemical studies of 35 fibrocystic pancreases were quantitatively related to the severity of the pancreatic involvement as follows. Water and volatile matter, normally accounting for 80 +/-% of the weight of the fresh pancreas, was reduced to less than 30% in the most affected organs. The concentration of zinc diminished from near normal mean levels of 193 mugZn/g dry pancreas to 10% of this amount in the severely involved pancreas. Elevated concentrations of calcium, amounting to over 10 times control level, were found in obstructed ductal structures. Calcium was depleted from pancreatic sections adjacent to the obstructions. The following biochemical indicators were significantly different in their mean levels in the 35 fibrocystic pancreases when compared with the 17 controls: (P less than or equal to 0.001) fat, water, zinc, calcium, copper, magnesium, potassium, and sodium (P less than or equal to 0.01).\\n',\n",

The average concentrations of spermidine causing a 50% inhibition of prolifertion (ID50) after 3 days of growth for three normal cell strains and three strains derived from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were 4.4 X 10(-6) +/- 1.2 M and 6.2 X 10(-6) +/- 2.1 M, respectively. The values for spermine were 2.0 X 10(-6) +/- 0.5 M for normal and 2.2 X 10(-6) +/- 0.1 M for fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients. No significant difference between the replicative ability of normal and CF cell strains was seen over a wide range of polyamine concentrations employed for a period of up to 3 days.\\n',\n",
       " 'Elevated levels of plasma CEA were found in patients with cystic fibrosis. The elevations were well correlated with the Shwachman scores of the patients. Parallel changes of the levels of plasma CEA and clinical conditions of four patients were also observed in the follow-up studies. Close clinical examination indicated that the elevated plasma CEA of cystic fibrosis patients may be derived from sputum which is produced in abnormal amounts. This hypothesis is further supported by the very high content and the chromatographic profile of the CEA activity of sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have obtained additional data which support the specificity of the reported serum glutathione reductase (GR) changes in cystic fibrosis (CF).  As in previous series, mean GR in CF was 20% greater than in controls (P < 0.005).  No difference was found between CF and controls for either lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT).  It appears that some underlying process or processes such as leakage into serum from cellular damage as reflected in raised LDH and GPT might lead to raised GR as demonstrated by positive correlations in controls.  The absence of a positive correlation between these enzymes and GR in the CF sample as well as normal values for LDH and GPT in CF suggests that the raised serum GR in CF is not attributable to tissue leakage from damaged cells secondary to the disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Parotid saliva was collected from 22 children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 21 control children. Stimulation was by 0.1 ml 5% citric acid on the tongue every 15 sec over a period of 10 min, and samples were collected for 2-min intervals. Stimulated saliva showed a lag period of low amylase release, and an activated period of higher amylase release. The major difference between CF and child control parotid saliva was in the elevated calcium concentrations in CF subjects. Flow rate and amylase, although higher in the CF group, were not raised to a statistically significant level. There were higher mean values for sodium and inorganic phosphate in CF children but statistical significance was minimal. Potassium values were almost identical in CF and control saliva. In the activated parotid saliva samples of both control and CF subjects there were positive correlations between flow rate and calcium, flow rate and sodium, anylase and calcium, and sodium and calcium, and negative correlations between sodium and potassium. The parotid function test has no value as a diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis, as even calcium values show too much overlap with control saliva to be of diagnostic worth.\\n',\n",
       " 'Two types of turbidity were found in parotid saliva from both cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and non-CF subjects. On cooling saliva, a rapidly forming, reversible, cold-dependent turbidity appeared in increasing amounts with decreasing temperature and increasing protein concentration. At 37 degrees, a slowly forming, stable turbidity appeared in increased amounts in parotid saliva samples containing increased amounts of calcium. The 2 degree centrifuged pellet consisted predominantly of protein, whereas the 37 degree pellet contained calcium, inorganic phosphate, and protein. The cold- dependent turbidity at 2 degrees was not inhibited by EDTA, but 37 degrees turbidity was dramatically inhibited. Urea and guanidine hydrochloride reduced 2 degree turbidity, and, to a lesser extent, inhibited 37 degree turbidity. The tendency towards higher levels of protein, amylase, and calcium in CF compared with child control parotid saliva (4, 6) causes a greater incidence and degree of turbidity formation in saliva of CF patients. In this paper only the nature of the turbidity has been investigated, not its relative occurrence in each group of subjects.\\n',\n",
       " 'A serum factor was demonstrated in normal individuals which (1) enhances the incorporation of L-[3H]fucose into cultured human skin fibroblasts, (2) is nondialyzable, (3) is heat labile at 50 degrees, (4) is present in the noneuglobulin fraction, and (5) appears to be deficient in serum from patients with cystic fibrosis. The specific activity of L-[3H]fucose incorporated into skin fibroblasts from normal individuals in the presence of serum from 12 control subjects was 3,337 +/- 168 cpm/mg protein in contrast to 2,294 +/- 172, the activity obtained either in the presence of serum from 10 age-matched patients with cystic fibrosis or in the absence of serum. These differences were significant at P less than 0.001. In comparison, no significant difference was detected in the amount of L-[3H]fucose incorporated into skin fibroblasts derived from normal individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis. The plasma membrane of cultured skin fibroblasts derived from patients with cystic fibrosis appears to be grossly unaltered in its protein and L-fucose labeling pattern.\\n',\n",
       " 'We examined serum proteins from 18 CF subjects and 14 control individuals.  We were unable to detect any consistent differences between the stained serum protein patterns of the CF and the control subjects.  These patterns show greater resolution of proteins than those previously published, but, in contrast, no consistent differences between CF and control subjects.  In addition, we have modified the published methods with procedures which would enhance the likelihood of electrophoretic detection of an abnormal protein with the reported properties.  A portion of the samples analyzed by the published procedures also were analyzed by each of these modifications.  None of the modified procedures showed consistent differences between serum proteins from the CF and the control subjects.  No explanation is readily apparent for the difference between results of Thomas et al. and our own results on the one hand and the previously reported results on the other.  We attempted to rigorously reproduce the isoelectric focusing techniques given in the literature.  However, isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel can be affected by small technical differences and, thus, factors essential to reproducing the techniques may not have been evident in the published procedure.\\n',\n",
       " 'A protein with an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.48 was found to be deficient in plasma from most cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and obligate heterozygote carriers of CF as compared with normal control plasma. Purification of the protein with a pI of 5.48 from normal plasma was performed using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE- cellulose and CM-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-200- gel filtration, starch block electrophoresis, and Sepharose 4B gel filtration. The purified protein migrated as a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and displayed a single arc on immunoelectrophoresis against polyvalent antiserum to whole human serum. Results from various techniques used in its characterization indicate that this protein is a fragment of alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) which is derived from alpha2M by proteolytic cleavage of intact alpha2M subunits. Quantitation of alpha2M levels in plasma indicated no significant differences between levels of alpha2M in CF homozygote, obligate heterozygote carrier, or normal control plasma samples. Quantitation of arginine esterase activity in plasma treated with cloroform and ellagic acid indicated that both the total arginine esterase activity and that fraction of arginine esterase activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) were decreased in most CF homozygote and obligate heterozygote plasma samples relative to normal control values. The results of this study indicate that plasma samples from CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygote carriers for CF show deficient proteolytic cleavage of alpha2M as compared with normal control plasma, and suggest that a structural abnormality in alpha2M or a deficiency in plasma proteolytic activity may be responsible for this deficiency in proteolysis.\\n',\n",
       " 'High speed cinemicrographs are made on the ciliary activity of rabbit tracheal cilia with the aid of Nomarski optics. The detailed nature of the ciliary beat pattern is determined from slow motion analysis of the high speed cinemicrographs (1-3). Such documented forms of ciliary beat pattern and the physiologic state of the tracheal epithelia are utilized as basic reference controls to investigate the physiologic effects of cystic fibrosis serum on ciliated epithelia and the cystic fibrosis tracheal mucus stagnation phenomenon. Careful analyses of the high speed cinemicrographs reveal that cystic fibrosis serum has no effect on the rhythm and beat pattern of rabbit tracheal cilia. However, it is shown in controlled procedures that cystic fibrosis serum has a cytolytic effect on the tracheal epithelial cells and also at the cell junctions. Ciliary dyskinesis, as described in previous reports (6-9), is actually a secondary effect of cytolysis and cell destruction.\\n',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this investigation was twofold: (1) to identify and characterize the enzymatic ATP hydrolysis system of epithelial cilia, and (2) to develop a quantitative, biochemical test for the ciliotoxic cystic fibrosis (CF) factor based on inhibition of ATP utilization by ciliary preparations. Our rationale for selecting this system for CF factor analysis relates to the tight and essential mechanochemical coupling of functioning cilia. Using rabbit tracheal epithelium as the source, a high molecular weight (greater than 200,000) ATPase was identified, partially purified, and extensively characterized. The properties of this protein were similar to those observed in previous studies of others with flagellar and ciliary dynein (the motility-associated ATPase) isolated from microorganisms. Analysis of the pH profile revealed a broad range of high enzymatic activity between 6.5 and 9. Studies with potential cation activators showed that the enzyme is activated equally by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ in equimolar concentrations. No activation occurred in the presence of Zn2+, Na+, H+, or Na+ plus K+ and the effect of Mg2+ or Ca2+ was not inhibited by Na+, K+, or Na+ plus K+. The enzyme hydrolyzed Mg2+- containing solutions of UTP, CTP, and ADP at 51-54% the rate of ATP dephosphorylation, whereas Mg-deoxy-ATP was hydrolyzed 79% as effectively as ATP. Using a newly devised, analytical technique with [gamma-32P]ATP as the substrate, the ATP hydrolysis of various ciliary preparations from rabbit trachea and oyster gill (including motile suspensions) was monitored in the presence of sera from CF homo- and heterozygotes. Reproducible rates of ATP dephosphorylation averaging 27 nmol/min/mg protein were demonstrable with homogenates of ciliated epithelium. None of the test systems evaluated, however, were capable of demonstrating CF-related differences in ATPase activity or ATP utilization. Although these attemps have been unsuccessful thus far, the approach described in this report provides an example of an objective, quantitative, biochemical assessment of ciliary function.\\n',\n",
       " 'A major feature of the disease cystic fibrosis is the excessive concentration of mucus within ducts and glands of mucous-producing organs. Some mucous secretions also show an elevation in calcium concentration. Using purified rat intestinal goblet cell mucin as a model mucin, we have investigated the effect of millimolar additions (1-25 mM) of CaCl2 on the physical properties of the mucin. Isotonicity of incubation media was preserved in order to mimic in vivo conditions. CaCl2 (8-15mM) caused a 15-33% decrease in viscosity, no change in electrophoretic mobility in acrylamide gels, and a 20-30% decrease in solubility of the mucin. Solubility changes were reversed by the addition of EDTA (20 mM) to incubations. Insolubility was also produced in incubations of mucin with a mixture of soluble intestinal contents (NaCl washings). These findings strongly suggest that the mucin became smaller and more dense as calcium was added, a process most probably achieved by loss of intramolecular water.\\n',\n",
       " 'Detection of cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) using out method involves rather exacting requirements for the collection of serum samples and their subsequent analysis by electrofocusing.  Minor variations in the methods described for sample collection and storage may cause degradation and loss of CFP and this by itself could lead to erroneous results since many CF samples would appear to be CFP negative, making it impossible to observe a consistent difference between a group of CF samples and normal control samples by electrofocusing.  From the results presented by Thomas et al. and Figure 1 of the letter by Smith et al., it is obvious that neither group has reproduced the protein handling patterns presented in either of our previous reports.  The pH gradients are not the same, the location of the sample pads relative to the anode are not the same, and the protein banding patterns are totally different.  We question the validity of the techniques used, claims of having reproduced our method for detecting CFP, or supposed improvements designed to enhance the detection of CFP.\\n',\n",
       " 'The ciliostatic cystic fibrosis (CF) factor has been investigated in order to develop an enzymatic assay for its detection. In saliva, this factor is associated with alpha-amylase. Removal or addition of the factor by dialysis does not affect the alpha-amylase catalytic activity of CF or control (normal) saliva. Crude preparations of the dialyzable factor from CF saliva are ciliostatic. Alpha-Amylase- catalyzed starch hydrolysis from both CF and control saliva was found to be insensitive to hydroxyalkylamine inhibitors so this method could not be used to detect differences in CF and control amylase. Since another carbohydrase, mammalian debranching enzyme, is much more sensitive to inhibition, the effect of the isolated crude factor on this enzyme was determined. The mean values for percentage of inhibition of debranching enzyme activity by fractions obtained from saliva of CF patients, obligate heterozygotes, and control subjects are: 32% (27 samples), 13% (21 samples), and 6% (11 samples), respectively. Fifteen of the CF values exceed the maximum 13% inhibition observed for controls. Indeed, five samples almost completely inhibited debranching enzyme. This inhibitory action provides the basis of an enzymatic assay for the detection of the ciliostatic CF factor.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lung lavage samples obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) had significantly higher levels of total protein per ml lavage fluid (0.49 vs. 0.30 mg/ml). A significant increase in the absolute and relative amounts of a low molecular weight glycoprotein (15,000 mol wt) was noted in lavage specimens from CF patients. Reserpine-treated rats also showed a significant increase in the total protein recovered in the lung lavage fluid with a 233% increase in the absolute and relative amounts of a low molecular weight glycoprotein (15,000 mol wt). Thus, reserpine induced changes in the secretions of the lung of the rat which are similar to those observed in samples obtained from the lung of CF patients.\\n',\n",

       " \"The papers by Elliott and by Campbell et al. suggest a new approach toward etiology, pathophysiology, and therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.  As in Elliott's original report of the effects of intravenous fatty acid therapy for CF, the patients in the present report fared remarkably well, particularly in regard to weight gain. The paper of Campbell et al. suggests that oxygen does not simply diffuse across membranes, but that instead its transport is influenced by the fatty acid composition of the membrane.  Elliott's suggestion that the disarranged fatty acid metabolism may be related to altered prostaglandin production is attractive.  These studies do not prove whether fatty acid and/or prostaglandin alterations are secondary to intestinal fat malabsorption or are related to the primary metabolic defect in CF.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Impaired oxygen supply and deteriorating health, in cystic fibrosis patients, correlates with abnormal changes in the fatty acid composition of blood lipids. As the proportion of oleates increases and that of linoleates decreases, erythrocyte membrane interference with the formation of intracellular oxyhemoglobin increases and arterial oxygen pressure decreases. The physical-chemical basis for these changes seems to be that oleic and linoleic acid differ in their ability to undergo reversible oxygenation in response to changes in oxygen pressure. The oxygen complex of linoleic acid dissociates at relatively high pressures, whereas that of oleic dissociates only at low pressures. Accordingly, excessive substitution of oleic for linoleic acid in membrane lipids would be expected to decrease the intracellular oxygen pressure to a level where hemoglobin oxygenation and any other oxygen-requiring processes would be impaired.\\n',\n",

Since organ culture of intestinal mucosa has been used to establish an in vitro model for the study of CD, we utilized this opportunity to determine whether duodenal mucosa obtained from each of these two patients and their immediate families differed in its organ culture behavior from mucosa obtained from patients with CD alone. Additionally, as specific HL-A types are associated with CD, we used HL-A typing to determine whether the two patients with CF-CD differed genetically from patients with CD alone. One of our patients was HL-A8, the most common type associated with CD; the other was HL-A12, as are many of the non-HL-A8 celiac patients. The response in organ culture of the mucosa of these two patients was the same as the response in organ culture of the mucosa from patients with CD alone. These and other data suggest that CD occurring in patients with CF is no different than CD occurring alone.\\n',\n",

I would suggest that the deleterious effects seen by Dietzsch et al. are due to their inattention to experimental detail and lack of communication with other investigators. - Dietzsch et al. give the impression in their article that all arginine solution are detrimental to the lung.  We wish to point out that L-arginine hydrochloride buffered with a sodium solution is irritative to the airway of cystic fibrosis patients.  However, no comparison studies were done with L-arginine buffered with free base. - The fate of these children with cystic fibrosis depends on the quality of the inhalation treatment.  This means if you replace a good mucolytic drug with a better one you step by step approach the ideal mucolytic solution.  We think it to be unethical to use other, less effective, drugs or solutions in a control group (e.g., saline or distilled water).  We did not state that arginine solutions are \"irritative\" or that arginine treatment is \"dangerous.\"  The N-acetylcysteine solution, which was successfully used before the treatment of our patients, was buffered with sodium hydroxide to a pH of 7.0.  The quantity of sodium which was administered during each inhalation amounts to only 0.04 mval of sodium so that an injurious pharmacological effect can be excluded.

After obtaining baseline pulmonary function tests before and after isoproterenol aerosol, 12 patients with CF were put on a double-blind trial of high-dosage theophylline (10 mg/kg three times per day) or placebo for four weeks and were then switched to the alternate regimen for the next four weeks. Patients had weekly evaluations of pulmonary function and plasma theophylline determinations. Gastrointestinal side effects were common with theophylline. The responses to aerosolized bronchodilators were inconsistent from week to week. After aerosolized bronchodilator, five of 12 patients had an average increase of 10% or more in FEF45%- 55% and FEF70%-80%. While taking oral theophylline, five patients had a 10% or more decrease in FEF 45%-55% and six patients had a decrease in FEF70%-80%. We conclude that there was no concordance between response to isoproterenol and theophylline, and that adrenergic and methylxanthine drugs must be used with caution in patients with CF.\\n',\n",

The order of solutions used was random and each subject received one treatment with each solution. The greatest overall improvement in function was seen with the bronchodilator and bronchial drainage.

Comparison of normal and cystic fibrosis cells showed that the latter had 2- to 5-fold greater levels of intracellular cyclic AMP after stimulation with isoproterenol. The difference between the strains was observed at every stage of the culture cycle and was specific to stimulation by beta-adrenergic agonists. It could not be accounted for by different dose- or time- response curves nor by leakage of cyclic AMP into the medium. The increased sensitivity to catecholamines may reflect an intrinsic genetic property of cystic fibrosis cells, and it may be feasible to use this system to study the biochemical basis of the genetic defect in cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",

Their mean age at the first visit was 17 years; they were followed for a mean period of 4 years and attended at least every six months. The first symptom which developed before the age of five in 42 of the 45 patients was respiratory. Thirty-two of the 45 patients had severe lung disease (Group III) at the start of the study of the seven patients died during the study. Cough and sputum were almost universal, 23 had haemoptyses and eight pneumothoraces. Staphylococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the common pathogens isolated from sputum and the increasing prevalence of the latter was again confirmed. Acquisition of the mucoid strain of pseudomonas signified poor prognosis. Established infection was never eradicated. Forty-three patients had evidence of pancreatic insufficiency; in all but one patient the symptoms were mild and five patients abandoned dietary restriction and pancreatin without ill effect. Seven patients had symptoms of partial bowel obstruction (meconium ileus equivalent) but only one required surgical relief. The liver was enlarged in seven patients and the spleen was felt in three. Three patients had diabetes mellitus. The influence of cystic fibrosis on growth and development is reported--the growth spurt is late in the majority but growth failure is not confined to those with severe lung infection or malabsorption and in these circumstances remains unexplained. Mean weight was low in relation to height and puberty was delayed in both sexes.\\n',\n",
       " \"To date, most cases of cystic fibrosis have been treated in pediatric hospitals.  With changes and advances in treatment, patients who were once considered terminally ill are now living into adulthood.  The stresses that result from chronic illness are considered herein from the standpoint of the social caseworker, who plans a crucial role on the patient-care team.  New problems regarding the personal development of the patient are presented, with particular emphasis on the role of a CF patient as a parent. The role of the respiratory therapist in the care of such patients is unique.  This is due to the extensiveness of patient contact, both verbal and physical, and to the primary threat that pulmonary disease poses to the patient with CF.  The therapist's ability to cope with the problem, while aiding the family and patient to do the same, becomes crucial to the child's rehabilitation.  The requirements for fulfilling this role are educational and developmental in nature, and should be pursued as a model for future patient care.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) activity was measured by radioimmunoassay in blood from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes, heterozygote carriers of CF, normal healthy controls, and other patient controls with carcinomas involving gastrointestinal organs. All samples were also screened by electrofocusing for cystic fibrosis protein (CFP), a metabolic marker previously shown to be associated with the CF gene. Significantly increased levels of CEA activity were found in all CFP-positive groups; however, with one exception all patient controls with marked increases in CEA activity were CFP- negative. Immunodiffusion of perchloric acid extracts of CEA-like material from heterozygote carrier blood indicated that the CEA-like material, which was elevated in homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, showed only partial identity with two separate CEA preparations obtained from colon carcinomas and was not identical to either A, B, or O(H) blood group substances. This glycoprotein material did, however, react with three different anti-CEA antisera. Our finding of an abnormally increased glycoprotein in cystic fibrosis, taken together with previous reports demonstrating abnormalities in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins found in various  exocrine secretions in CF, further suggests that the primary defect in this disease is manifested partly as a defect in glycoprotein metabolism. This defect may result from an abnormality in one or more of the glycosyltransferases, possibly caused by a more primary defect in polyamine metabolism.\\n',\n",
       " 'The distribution of serological types of D. pneumoniae was investigated in 40 strains isolated from 26 children with cystic fibrosis and 57 strains isolated from 39 children with other diseases. All strains were isolated from sputum or tracheal secretion. The strains from cystic fibrosis patients belonged to 14 different serological types, the most prevalent were 19F, 19A and 3. The strains from the other group of children belonged to 20 different serological types, the most prevalent were 23F, 19F and 11A. The differences between the two groups of patients as to the prevalences of types were small, and it is concluded that no special serological types of D. pneumoniae are associated with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fifty-six non-haemolytic Haemophilus strains were isolated during current bacteriological examinations from material from the lower respiratory tract of 39 patients with cystic fibrosis during a 6- month period. Except for six strains which belonged to Haemophilus parainfluenzae, all strains were identified as Haemophilus influenzae. Biotype I of H. influenzae was the predominating taxon (38%) and was especially related to patients with recurrent or prolonged colonization. Only two strains were capsulated. An unexpectedly high percentage of the strains produced lysine decarboxylase. The significance of this property in the pathogenesis of the respiratory tract colonization is discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'It was decided to treat all seventeen cystic fibrosis patients under our care who were known to have active infection with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas, using large intravenous doses of tobramycin.  By the objective observations made, results were not so satisfactory. Changes in white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate seemed often to conflict with clinical impression of improvement. However, there was closer agreement between subjective judgements, weight gain and respiratory function changes.  Eradication of Pseudomonas from the sputum was achieved in four cases, although the duration of follow-up in one was very short.\\n',\n",
       " 'Data on the prevalence of divorce and separation among parents of children with cystic fibrosis and other chronic diseases indicate that marital breakdown is no more prevalent among these couples than it is in a general population.  For couples who attended genetic counseling clinics or had children with spina bifida or leukemia, the divorce rate is lower than the United States national average. For parents of children with cystic fibrosis, the divorce rate is the same as the national average.  The high recurrence risk for cystic fibrosis may deter many parents from further reproduction. We speculate that the inability to plan more children may be the factor responsible for the higher prevalence among these parents compared to those of children with other chronic diseases.\\n',\n",

       " 'Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive autosomal genetic disease in which exocrine glands secrete highly viscous mucus.  Variable genetic penetrance (\"organ sparing\") results in a broad spectrum of clinical presentations.  The diagnosis of CF is usually established by the presence of chronic obstructive lung disease and/or gastrointestinal dysfunction, together with elevated levels of sweat electrolytes (chloride > 60 mEq/liter), markedly diminished duodenal pancreatic enzyme concentrations, or pathologic changes in tissue.  Family history may occasionally be helpful.  The metabolic basis of CF is unknown.  The classic stereotype of the CF patient is an infant with a chronic cough, diarrhea, and growth failure.  Improved medical care is enabling many of these patients to reach adulthood, and increased diagnostic suspicion is resulting in identification of the disease in more adults.  Based upon analysis of over 11,000 cases of CF reported during the year 1974 by 119 Cystic Fibrosis Centers, the National Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimated that the probability of an individual with CF surviving to age 20 was approximately 39%. Although most of these adults are currently under the care of pediatricians, the development of medical, psychiatric, surgical, or obstetric complications may necessitate the involvement of other professionals.  A joint study of cystic fibrosis in adults conducted by Duke Medical Center and the NIH has shown that the majority of affected adults, including those diagnosed early in life, are married and work full- or part-time.  Many manifest few if any symptoms until relatively late in life.  Since this study was retrospective, the reported frequencies of the clinical findings tend to underestimate, in all instances, the actual incidence in the population studied. The reported incidence of CF in the United States has been conservatively estimated at 1:2,000 live births.  If all adults with clubbing, infertility, and other symptoms were evaluated for CF, the true incidence would certainly be higher.\\n',\n",
       " 'Parotid saliva samples from cystic fibrosis homozygotes, heterozygotes and normal individuals were tested by the zeta potential technique for secretion factor in a double-blind experiment. There was no overlap between zeta potential reduction of the control group and the cystic fibrosis test groups, indicating that the zeta potential test may be detecting a unique component in saliva of cystic fibrosis genotypes.\\n',\n",
       " 'The capacity of skin fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF individuals to incorporate exogenous L-fucose into various metabolic pools was compared. Incorporation into intracellular acid-soluble pools and extracellular glycopeptides was measured by a dual-label co- chromatographic technique, whereas total macromolecular incorporation was measured by a single-label procedure. Although CF and normal fibroblasts incorporate exogenous fucose into intracellular acid- soluble and high molecular weight compounds in a similar manner, CF cells appear to be characterized by an increased incorporation of label into low molecular weight extracellular glycopeptides.\\n',\n",

       " 'The effect of plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene on the active uptake of 3-0-14C-methyl- D-glucose (3-0-14C-MDG) by rat jejunal epithelium was studied. Furthermore, the role of the polyamine, spermidine, and its products of metabolic degradation on glucose transport were investigated, and a relationship to the pathogenesis of membrane dysfunction in cystic fibrosis was postulated. Glucose transport in everted rat jejunal rings was used in the study. Results were expressed as 3-0-14C-MDG concentration ratio between the intracellular (ICF) and the extracellular fluid spaces (ECF) of the jejunal rings at the end of a 60 min incubation period. The mean ratio obtained from incubations of the rat jejunal rings in medium consisting of Krebs-Ringer- bicarbonate buffer and the labeled sugar was considered as 100% uptake. When plasma or serum, with or without spermidine, was mixed with the medium in a volume ratio of 1:3, a decrease in the active uptake of 3-0-14C-MDG was observed, expressed as percent inhibition. Percent inhibition of 3-0-14C-MDG uptake obtained when the rat jejunal rings were incubated in normal plasma was compared to that obtained with plasma from cystic fibrosis genotypes. It was found that: 1) plasma from 25 homozygous children had greater inhibitory effect on glucose uptake than plasma from 26 normal children; 2) plasma from 9 heterozygous women had greater inhibitory effect than that from 6 normal women; 3) the inhibitory effect of plasma from 3 homozygous children was not influenced by dialysis; 4) the inhibitory effects of paired plasma and serum samples from 9 homozygotes were comparable; 5) spermidine added to the incubating electrolyte solution did not affect glucose transport; 6) the addition of spermidine to reaction mixtures containing normal plasma potentiated the inhibitory effect; and 7) mixing and incubation of fresh bovine serum with reaction mixtures containing plasma from homozygotes decreased the inhibitory effect. The predominant inhibitory effect of plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for the CF gene appears to be related to a nondialyzeable molecule(s). It does not seem to reflect the presence of high plasma glucose levels in cystic fibrosis nor to be the result of competitive inhibition between sugars. It does not seem to be the result of sodium or other electrolyte differences. A similar inhibitory effect is acquired by normal plasma after the addition of spermidine. On the other hand, plasma from CF homozygotes loses its inhibitory effect after incubation with fresh bovine serum. These findings may indicate that products of metabolic degradation of spermidine are responsible for the inhibitory effect of glucose transport and suggest the possibility of a role in abnormal polyamine metabolism in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ultrastructural analysis including scanning and transmission electron microscopic studies (SEM and TEM) were carried out on oyster gill tissue after exposure either to serum fractions from individuals homozygous or heterozygous for cystic fibrosis (CF), to comparable serum fractions from normal individuals, or to sea water. In 4 of the experiments examined topologically (SEM), the CF sera (either heterozygous or homozygous) stimulated the production of mucus that was found in close association with the cilia. The association of excessive mucus with the cell surface could be responsible, in part, for the well-known inhibition of ciliary activity by a factor in CF serum. In 3 additional SEM experiments involving shorter treatment times, very little difference could be observed between homozygous CF, heterozygous CF, and normal serum-fraction-treated oyster tissues. In parallel experiments, ultrathin sections of gill tissue were examined by means of TEM. Those samples that were responsive, as determined by TEM, displayed several characteristic features, including enlarged and partially exuded goblet cells, altered mucus structure along with twisted and matted cilia. An overall swelling of the gill filament was also observed in the responsive tissues. From TEM analysis no detectable alteration in fine structure was apparent in gill tissues that were treated with sera from heterozygous or normal individuals.\\n',\n",
       " 'The cystic fibrosis ciliary inhibitor (CFCI) has been partially purified from serum and plasma of cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and heterozygotes, and from media of cultured fibroblasts derived from cystic fibrosis genotypes. Characterization and comparison of fractions containing the CFCI were carried out by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis confirmed previous molecular weight estimations of 4,500 to 11,000 for the CFCI and provided an estimate of the number of proteins present in the fractions. Low molecular weight proteins from serum and media were combined with IgG preparations. No specific binding to IgG by the media fraction containing the CFCI could be demonstrated by the techniques employed. There was decreased binding of the low molecular weight serum fraction containing CFCI to native IgG molecules from cystic fibrosis patients as compared to IgG from normal individuals. However, IgG from CF individuals demonstrated increased binding of the cfci- containing low molecular weight serum fraction after gel filtration in the presence of guanidinium chloride. This suggests: 1) that very low concentrations of CFCI are present in media fractions; and 2) that native CF IgG cannot bind the low molecular weight CFCI fractions to the same degree as native IgG from normals or CF IgG that has been dissociated from non-covalently bound components.\\n',\n",

       " 'Fibroblasts derived from cystic fibrosis homozygotes and heterozygotes were compared to normal fibroblasts topologically, ultrastructurally, and microchemically. Topological examinations, by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed no significant differences between the 3 genotypes surveyed. The cells were generally flattened and/or fusiform structures that were more or less devoid of surface details. However, the dividing cells, in all of the populations surveyed, were found to have a more or less spherical configuration involving a highly complicated surface. The surface manifestations included blebs, ridges, and microvilli. Representative samples of the cells in all stages of growth, lag phase, exponential phase, and plateau phase, were surveyed in this study. Ultrastructurally, the fibroblasts of the 3 genotypes were found to have similar cytological detail. Highly infolded nuclei, distinct organelle components, and surface details, also seen in the SEM study, were observed. Numerous bundles of microfilaments were noted within the cytoplasm. Metachromatic granules were observed in cells from all 3 genotypes. Microchemical analysis, by means of energy dispersive X-ray analysis, demonstrated slight but recognizable differences in the elemental composition of the 3 genotypes. Of notable interest were the peak intensities of calcium and sulfur. The CF homozygous cells presented higher values for both of the elements when compared to the values observed in the CF heterozygous and normal cell populations. Although consistent differences could be observed in the CF genotypes when compared to the non-CF cells, no attempt was made to quantitate the concentrations of each of the elements within the cells.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited disorder which is characterized by the production of exocrine secretions with elevated ion content and abnormally viscous mucus. Over the last few years cells obtained from the peripheral blood or cultured from tissues of cystic fibrosis patients have been used increasingly in the study of the disease. Investigations of the following properties of cystic fibrosis cells are reviewed: morphology, ultrastructure, growth kinetics, cellular metachromasia, the production of ciliary inhibitors, cellular composition, plasma membrane composition, the transport of inorganic ions and small organic molecules, lysosomal enzyme content, and RNA methylation. Studies of the effects on cultured cells and erythrocyte membranes of factors in CF cell culture medium and biological fluids from CF patients are discussed.\\n',\n",

       " 'Recent research in cystic fibrosis has suggested at least two theories regarding the genetic defect underlying this prevalent disease: that a mutant gene in cystic fibrosis genotypes is responsible for the synthesis of an altered protein that interferes with membrane transport and mucociliary activity; and that a mutant gene in cystic fibrosis genotypes is responsible for an enzyme deficiency leading to the presence of undegraded metabolites that interfere with membrane transport.  Circulating factors in cystic fibrosis and their effects on membrane transport and mucociliary systems are discussed, as are the search for an enzymatic deficiency and investigations of altered metabolic pathways.  Comparison of somatic cells from cystic fibrosis and normal genotypes is also outlined.\\n',\n",
       " 'One of the most consistent characteristics of cystic fibrosis is the abnormal handling of electrolytes by exocrine glands. The present study has examined the possibility that diminished respiratory energy formation is a primary biochemical error responsible for this abnormality. Using oxygen consumption of intact larval brine shrimp, quantitative differences have been observed from reaction of mixed mouth saliva between CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes. In addition, information demonstrating a correlation between a biochemical abnormality and disease severity was observed. The differences observed in inhibition by saliva from both CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes may occur as the result of 1) interference with electron transfer from organic fuel molecules to molecular oxygen or 2) interference with the mechanism responsible for generating the biochemical reducing power necessary for multiple biosynthetic reactions.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sera and lymphocyte culture media derived from cystic fibrosis (CF)- affected and carrier subjects contain ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF) detected by our rabbit tracheal bioassay. In addition, we also find CDF in fibroblast media from these same donors and in amniotic fluid cell media derived from CF carrier or affected fetuses. In these latter instances, the media were inactive in the bioassay, but became active when mixed with purified IgG. In all instances, CDF activity was eliminated by the addition of anti-IgG. We have separated a low molecular weight fraction, between 1,000 and 10,000 M.W., from CF sera and culture media which is inactive in the bioassay until IgG is added. Presumptive and indirect evidence indicates that this fraction behaves similarly to the complement derived anaphylatoxin C3a. In addition, we have found activity in sera from CF patients and, to a lesser extent, carriers that induces degranulation of cytochalasin-B- treated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Since this activity appears to be in a different molecular species from that containing CDF, we postulate that the primary defect in CF is the deficiency of an enzyme whose substrates include a family of membrane-active molecules.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sera from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes contain a CF factor (gamma CF factor) not found by isoelectric focusing in thin-layer polyacrylamide gels in most normal control sera. In addition, sera from most obligate heterozygotes lack another protein (bland B, C, or D) that is commonly found in sera from most normal and cystic fibrosis individuals. A standardized, biophysical assay is described that employs isoelectric focusing for the detection of both CF homozygotes and heterozygotes based on the analysis of whole serum for the presence of the gamma CF factor and bands B, C, and D. Results of analyzing sera from selected CF patients by isoelectric focusing indicated that there is a general correlation between the amount of the gamma CF factor and the clinical severity of the disease. Partial purification and characterization of the gamma CF factor and protein bands B, C,  and D was accomplished by using DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G- 200 gel filtration, sequential molecular filtration through a series of Amicon Diaflo ultrafiltration membranes, affinity chromatography, and cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The gamma CF factor is a cationic protein with a pI of 8.46+/-0.05, has gamma electrophoretic mobility, a molecular weight between 3,500 and 10,000, and apparently exists in CF serum in 2 forms (free in solution and complexed to IgG). Bands B, C, and D are cationic proteins with pI values of 7.85 to 8.10, have gamma electrophoretic mobility and a molecular weight of approximately 100,000-150,000.\\n',\n",
       " 'The cystic fibrosis ciliary inhibitor (CFCI) has been fractionated from plasma of cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and from the media of cultured fibroblasts derived from CF homozygotes. Plasma and fibroblast media from normal controls have been fractionated in an identical manner. Fractions from plasma and fibroblast culture media that demonstrate ciliary inhibitory activity contain several proteins in a molecular weight range of approximately 5,000-11,000. These proteins have been partially characterized by immunochemical analysis with antisera to 33 human serum proteins. Immunological determinants of albumin, C3 (but not C3a), C4, C5, alpha1-lipoprotein, beta- lipoprotein, beta2-microglobulin and immunoglobulin light chains have been detected by hemagglutination in fractions of CF plasma that inhibited ciliary activity and in analogous fractions from normal sera. None of the proteins were detected in media of cultured fibroblasts from either genotype. Since the same proteins and protein fragments were identified in both CF and normal plasma fractions, and were not detected in CF fibroblast media, it appears that none of these proteins can be identified as the CFCI. Identification of these proteins will permit further purification of the CFCI by immunochemical methods.\\n',\n",
       " 'Membrane function was examined in cultured cells from cystic fibrosis patients by assaying several enzymes on intact skin fibroblasts attached to culture dishes. This technique required few cells and minimized disruption of cellular organization. Comparison of enzyme activities of intact and broken cells showed that 12% of total glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, was measurable using intact cells, while all adenosine monophosphatase was measurable using intact cells. Alkaline paranitrophenylphosphatase activity was divided between the cell surface and interior. Substrate competition experiments indicated that substrate specificities for adenosine monophosphatase and paranitrophenylphosphatase activities were different. Adenosine monophosphatase activities of 2 control and 2 cystic fibrosis strains fluctuated similarly during the cell culture cycle. The apparent Km values relative to adenosine monophosphate were similar in all strains. A chromatographic fraction of serum from a cystic fibrosis patient that was inhibitory to oyster ciliary activity had no effect on adenosine monophosphatase activity of normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, fractions of media from cystic fibrosis homozygote and heterozygote fibroblast cultures were not inhibitory to adenosine monophosphatase activities of intact normal fibroblasts or of part iculate fractions prepared from them. In light of previous studies that showed that factors from cystic fibrosis serum of culture medium disrupted specific membrane activities, it is proposed that the cystic fibrosis factor interacts with the plasma membrane, interfering most conspicuously with the protein functions that are sensitive to changes in their membrane environment.\\n',\n",
       " 'The growth kinetics of human diploid skin fibroblasts derived from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes, CF heterozygotes and normal individuals was determined. The population doubling times increased with time in culture, and no difference was observed between the 3 genotypes tested. The cell cycle times remained constant through the 10th subculture, while the growth fraction, or fraction of cells in the cell cycle, decreased with culture time; however, changes in the growth fraction and population doubling time appear to be related to cellular senescence in vitro rather than to cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Immunoglobulin levels and precipitating antibody against a range of microbial antigens were measured in simultaneously collected serum and sputum samples from patients with chronic bronchitis (11), cystic fibrosis (9), bronchiectasis (9), and asthma (4). Sputum was prepared by dialysis and high-speed centrifugation methods. Results showed that it was possible to detect precipitating antibody in the sputum, and the rate was increased when both methods were used. A discrepancy was noted between the detection rate in the sputum and serum. This, combined with the lack of correlation between sputum and serum immunoglobulins, lack of relationship between bronchial inflammation and sputum immunoglobulins, and the lack of IgM in the sputum suggested that the antibody and immunoglobulin were locally produced. Sputum IgA (7S) in patients with chronic bronchitis was significantly lower (P less than 0-05) than that found in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Significant differences (P less than 0- 05) were also noted in serum IgG levels between patients with chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis while serum IgM levels in patients with chronic bronchitis were significantly lower (P less than 0-05) when compared to serum levels in patients with cystic fibrosis. The presence of precipitating antibody in the sputum raises the possibility that type III reactions may be important in the pathogenesis of these conditions.\\n',\n",
       " 'Anatomical dead space was measured in 72 normal children aged from 5 to 16 years, using the single breath method. There was a linear increase in this measurement with height, weight, and end-inspiratory lung volume. Physiological dead space was measured in 52 normal children using the Bohr equation and substituting a rebreathing PCO2 for alveolar PCO2. There was a parallel increase in this measurement with height, weight, and end-inspiratory lung volume. The difference between the two dead space measurements constitutes the alveolar dead space and was constant over the whole age range at 45 +/- 22 ml. The ratio of physiological dead space to tidal volume was 33-6 +/-4-6% and was unaltered by age or change in lung volume. The effect of airways obstruction on the dead space volumes was studied in 36 children with asthma and 28 with cystic fibrosis. Physiological dead space increased with increasing airways obstruction. Anatomical dead space remained constant in spite of marked increases in lung volume associated with the airways obstruction.\\n',\n",

This report documents the first association of these two diseases in the same patient in the United States and shows how Crohn's disease alters the gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis.

In comparison with 130 healthy blood donors typed for 29 HLA antigens. B18 proved to be more frequent in the group of patients and gene carriers, with 50 and 31%, respectively, and 14% in the normal population.

       " 'A simple method has been elaborated for the routine separation and quantitative determination of amylase isoenzymes. The ratio P/S, the quotient of the activity values obtained by densitometric evaluation of the pancreatic and salivary isoenzymes, is used to characterize their distribution. In healthy adults and children the value for P/S is above 1 in 80% of the cases, with a mean of 1.87 +/- 0.23. In 90% of heterozygote CF gene-carriers, the P/S is below 1 with a mean of 0.68 +/- 0.13. In addition to the higher total amylase activity, in MV homozygote patients P/S is less than 0.1, and even 0.001. The phenomenon is explained by a compensatory enhancement of salivary activity. The method is a suitable diagnostic test of the exocrine function of the pancreas and for evaluation of the serum amylase isoenzymes. The P/S value allows to differentiate heterozygote CF gene-carriers from homozygotes and healthy individuals.\\n',\n",
       " \"The glucagon and insulin responses to intravenous arginine were studied in 17 children with cystic fibrosis and in 9 control children. It was found that the overall secretion of insulin was diminished; however, four of the CF children did have a normal output. The glucagon responses did not parallel those of insulin. The glucagon output varied in the CF children--seven had normal, four excessively high and six low output. Three of the four children with extremely high output had more severe disease and were below the third centile on the weight chart. These four had a fasting hypoglycaemia and also a very low glucose and insulin response. We have confirmed diminished insulin secretion in cystic fibrosis, but diminished glucagon secretion was only noted when some insulin secretion was preserved. The high levels of glucagon seen in the most insulin deficient subjects may be derived from extrapancreatic sources, or may be associated with 'stress' reaction in these patients who also had most severe pulmonary involvement. The data would be consistent with diminished glucagon and insulin secretion from the pancreas but as the disease progresses an excessive secretion of extra pancreatic glucagon results.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Thirty-one patients with cystic fibrosis of varying severity were examined by echocardiography. Right ventricular dimension (RVD) was above upper normal limit in 14 patients and right ventricular dimension index (RVD index) was higher than the upper normal limit in 11 patients. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between increasing RVD index and 1) decreasing forced vital capacity (FVC) both actual test results and average 6 months values; and 2) decreasing peak-expiratory flow rate (PEFR) both actual test results and average 6 months values. This observation suggests a persistent heart involvement. Five patients had either heart failure and/or electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular abnormality. These patients had increased RVD index and one patient with the highest RVD index died 8 weeks after the examination. The present study has shown the usefulness of echocardiographic measurement of right ventricular dimension and of septal motion in assessing cor pulmonale, before development of electrocardiographic abnormalities and right heart failure.\\n',\n",
       " 'Eleven patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) chronically infected with mucoid P. aeruginosa and ten patients without P. aeruginosa infection were examined for occurrence of circulating immune complexes, for immune complex deposits in the dermo-epidermal junction of the skin and for precipitins against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, H. influenzae and D. pneumoniae antigens. The serum concentrations of haptoglobin, orosomucoid, immunoglobulins, C1q, C3, C4 and total haemolytic complement, antinuclear and rheumatoid factor activities as well as white blood cell counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were determined also. The results indicated that 6 patients from the chronically P. aeruginosa infected group, exhibiting a spectrum of serum precipitins against P. aeruginosa antigens, also had immune complexes in the serum, while only one patient (suffering from selective IgA deficiency) in the group without P. aeruginosa infection was positive for soluble immune complexes. Granular deposits of IgM was found in the skin of 10 of the chronically P. aeruginosa infected patients and in 7 of the patients without P. aeruginosa infection. A few pactients in both groups had dermo- epidermal deposits of C1q, C3 or fibrinogen as well. Eight of the patients in the chronically infected group and five in the group without P. aeruginosa infection had organ non-specific antinuclear factors. The haptoglobin levels appeared to be elevated in the chronically infected patients (p less than 0.05). None of the other parameters showed any significant difference between the two groups.\\n',\n",
       " 'P. aeruginosa strains originating from the respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and patients with other diseases (non-CF) were analysed with regard to their sensitivity to the bactericidal activity of human serum. P. aeruginosa strains isolated from CF patients were more sensitive than strains from non-CF patients to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum. The bactericidal activity was heatlabile. As regards the sensitivity to normal human serum, mucoid and non-mucoid variants were not found to differ. Strains originating from chronically infected CF patients with many precipitins against these bacteria did not differ with respect to serum sensitivity from strains originating from intermittently colonized CF patients without P. aeruginosa precipitins. Compared with normal sera, CF sera showed similar or higher bactericidal activity against a panel of P. aeruginosa strains. In this respect, any difference between CF sera with precipitins and CF sera without precipitins against P. aeurginosa was not found. Sera from three CF patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, and with many precipitins against these bacteria, showed a selective inability in bactericidal activity against the patients\\' own P. aeruginosa isolate possibly reflecting the presence of \"bactericidal blocking\" antibodies.\\n',\n",
       " 'The purpose of the first part of the present work is to review the literature concerning the lower respiratory tract infections and the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in cystic fibrosis patients. The second part of the work deals with the most important therapeutical problem in cystic fibrosis today, viz. the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection.  A survey is made of the investigations of the present author and his colleagues into the immune response against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and the literature concerning these subjects.  Furthermore, the possible mechanisms of tissue damage in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients during these infections are discussed.\\n',\n",

The presence of precipitins against cathodic migrating P. aeruginosa antigens was investigated by means of classical immunoelectrophoresis. Thirty-six per cent of the sera contained precipitins against both anodic and cathodic antigens, 20% contained only precipitins against anodic antigens, none contained only precipitins against cathodic antigens, and 44% had no demonstrable P. aeurginosa precipitins. The amount of extra information obtained by combining the results of classical immunoelectrophoresis with the results of crossed immunoelectrophoresis was small.\\n',\n",
       " 'Treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease should first be directed at prevention.  The hypersecretion of mucus, even in the absence of pus in the sputum or of other signs of infection, is of itself associated with significantly poor lung function.  Infection is probably the important stimulus in cystic fibrosis.  Certain anti-inflammatory agents are now known to cause retention of mucus within the secretory cells although the rate of synthesis is not raised.  It may be that this offers a new way of control.  On the other hand, the cells become larger and this may be undesirable.  I would prefer to see a study of the effect of drugs on the cellular stages of synthesis and discharge rather than concentration on mucolytic agents.\\n',\n",
       " 'The Weissenberg rheogoniometer is designed to estimate viscosity at a single applied shear.  By varying this shear, the associated detailed variation of viscosity may be studied.  The level of viscosity depends more on the macroscopic appearance of the sample than the disease with which it may be associated.  This has particular significance in relation to cystic fibrosis.  In cystic fibrosis, the sputum viscosity is not abnormally high.  It is not higher than that of macroscopically similar sputum from chronic bronchitis or asthma.  Whatever the feature differentiating cystic fibrosis from other diseases, it is not the viscosity of the sputum.\\n',\n",

The 26 patients with a nonvisualized gallbladder following double-dosage oral cholecystography were evaluated with intravenous cholangiography; 19 (70.3%) of these were abnormal. Ten patients were found to have calculi, an incidence of 11.9%. Awareness of the high incidence of cholecystographic abnormalities and calculi should be helpful in the evaluation of patients with cystic fibrosis, particularly since symptoms of abdominal pain are frequent in such patients and may lead to radiographic investigations.\\n',\n",
       " \"Studies have shown that children with chronic illnesses are more prone to develop secondary handicaps in the areas of educational achievement, behavior, and psychological maladjustment than are 'normal' children.  Besides his physical symptoms, the child with a chronic illness must endure prolonged hospitalization, psychological stresses, decreased activity, and is often denied opportunity for skill practice and peer group activities.  All these factors result in an overall decrease in sensory stimulation which could impair perceptual-motor functioning as well as the child's ability to successfully adapt to his disease.  Therefore, the purpose of this research was to obtain a general idea of the perceptual-motor or sensory integrative development of children with CF, to determine if there is, in fact, a need for sensory integrative treatment in the care of these children.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cumulative survival in cystic fibrosis (CF) for three successive 5-year periods between 1952 and 1967 is 35%, 64%, and 77%, respectively.  Operative mortality in meconium ileus is not reduced to 25% from 70%.  N-Acetylcysteine effectively cleanses the bowel of tenacious meconium plugs when directly injected during laparotomy. However, Mucomist enema alone generally does not suffice.  Selected cases have been treated successfully with hyperosmolar Gastrograffin enema.  Several screening tests, based on the increased albumin concentrations present in the meconium, are available for CF.  The Boehringer-Mannheim test strip is favored, and yielded no false positives in 69,000 tests of meconium.  However, 4 of 60 neonates who subsequently proved to have CF had false negative tests.  A pathognomonic elevation of sodium and chloride concentrations in the sweat collected by pilocarpine iontophoresis remains the definitive diagnostic test.  Bile acid malabsorption occurs in CF but not in celiac disease.  The authors postulate that the presence of maldigested materials or the absence of pancreatic enzymes interferes with bile acid absorption.  The defect disappears with pancreatic extracts.  Substitution of medium-chain triglycerides for dietary long-chain fatty acids reduces steatorrhea in CF.  However, the positive effect of MCT on weight gain is transitory.  Growth retardation correlates better with the degree of pulmonary disease than with pancreatic insufficiency.\\n',\n",
       " 'Echocardiograms were obtained for 25 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 20 controls to evaluate this technique as a means of assessment of right ventricular changes in patients with CF. Right ventricular anterior wall thickness per square meter of body surface (RVAW/sq m) and right ventricular internal dimension per square meter of body surface (RVID/sq m) were compared with other techniques for detection of cor pulmonale. Significant correlations existed between both RVAW/sq m and RVID/sq m and the forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, midmaximal expiratory flow rate, clinical score of severity of disease, and roentgenographic score of pulmonary involvement. The RVAW/sq m was slightly more sensitive than RVID/sq m; RVAW/sq m thickness on echocardiogram in vivo compared well with actual measurements at autopsy in five patients. No correlations were found between echocardiography and electrocardiograms, vectorcardiograms, thoracic index, or cardiothoracic ratio.\\n',\n",
       " 'We report two siblings with cystic fibrosis and systemic amyloidosis. The major clinical problem in both cases was recurrent respiratory infection with pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiectasis prior to death at ages 20 and 22 years. Findings from postmortem examinations disclosed diffuse amyloidosis. In addition, amyloid infiltration developed in both patients, with enlargement of the thyroid gland, and one required thyroidectomy. An autopsy review of 17 additional cases of cystic fibrosis failed to disclose any other instances of systemic amyloidosis.\\n',\n",
       " \"Data on 16 sibling pairs with cystic fibrosis were analyzed to test the hypothesis that early treatment of this condition improves prognosis. Younger siblings' conditions were diagnosed before 1 year of age, usually before the onset of pulmonary disease. Older siblings' conditions were diagnosed after 1 year of age and after the onset of pulmonary disease. Although the sibling pairs received similar treatment, comparison at 7 years of age showed that the younger siblings had significantly better chest roentgenogram scores, total clinical scores, residual lung volumes, and ratios of residual volume to total lung volume. Younger siblings also required fewer hospital admissions to control their lung disease. The results suggest that, in general, early initiation of therapy is beneficial for patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",

All infants born during one year in 14 Milwaukee area hospitals were tested. Of 16,224 newborns, two were diagnosed correctly as suffering from cystic fibrosis and two were missed. False-positive tests were obtained in 0.9% of infants (prematurity, melena, gastroschisis, and intrauterine infection).

Steatosis can result from the following mechanism(s): impaired TGC clearance; increased hepatic lipogenesis; decreased FA oxidation; and increased lipolysis.  Cystic fibrosis  and syndromes producing pancreatic insufficiency (pancreatitis) result in a variable degree of steatosis most probably dependent on the nutritional and hormonal state of the patient.  Patients with cystic fibrosis have impaired glucagon and insulin release which alters their fat metabolism.  The treatment of hepatic steatosis is aimed at the primary cause.\\n',\n",

However, the impression given by Townes et al. in their article is that their data are the first demonstration of isoamylase abnormalities in cystic fibrosis.  I wish to point out that out previous work published 2 years earlier and not referenced by Townes et al. demonstrated that CF patients had decreased amounts of pancreatic isoamylase in their serum and urine and that the duodenal aspirates in CF patients contained both salivary and pancreatic amylase.  We concluded, as eluded to by Townes et al., that salivary amylase in the duodenal fluid was probably secondary to the intubation procedure.\\n',\n",

In both cases, lipids constituted 30 to 40 per cent of the dry insoluble material and phosphatidylcholine was the predominant lipid. Significant amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidyglycerol were present. Hexosyl ceramides, spingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid were present as minor lipid components. Appreciable quantities of neutral lipids were also found. Significant amounts of lysophosphatides and free fatty acids were present only in the lavage sediment from patients with asthma, and not in patients with cystic fibrosis. Phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidycholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylglycerol of asthmatic lavage, but not cystic lavage, were highly saturated, containing mostly palmitic acid.\\n',\n",
       " 'It has long been believed that the mucociliary apparatus of the airways serves to remove inhaled particulate matter from the tracheobronchial mucosa, thereby contributing to pulmonary host defense.  This review deals mainly with factors affecting mucociliary transport that may be of clinical importance.  The information available at present strongly suggests that mucociliary transport, at least in central airways, is impaired in most patients with cystic fibrosis; however, it is still unclear whether this disorder is a nonspecific feature of the chronic inflammatory airway disease or represents an essential factor in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary abnormalities.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ventilatory muscles can become fatigued, and this can contribute to respiratory failure. Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease may benefit from improving their ventilatory muscle endurance to improve resistance to fatigue. Ventilatory muscle endurance was measured in 30 normal subjects and 55 patients with cystic fibrosis by finding the highest level of normocapnic hyperpnea that could be sustained for 15 min. Subjects with cystic fibrosis had 36 per cent higher ventilatory muscle endurance than normal subjects, reflecting the chronic training stress of breathing against increased respiratory loads. Four normal subjects and 4 subjects with cystic fibrosis participated in a specific ventilatory muscle endurance training program consisting of 25 min per day of maximal normocapnic hyperpnea 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The cystic fibrosis patients who trained improved their ventilatory muscle endurance by 51.6 per cent, whereas the normal subjects who trained showed a 22.1 per cent increase in ventilatory muscle endurance. Seven subjects with cystic fibrosis participated in a 4-week physical activity training program consisting of at least 1.5 hours per day of intensive swimming and canoeing at summer camp. They increased their ventilatory muscle endurance by 56.7 per cent. There were no other pulmonary function changes. Ventilatory muscle endurance can be readily improved in cystic fibrosis equally well by specific ventilatory muscle endurance exercise.\\n',\n",
       " 'As patients with cystic fibrosis survive longer, the number of adults with this chronic obstructive lung disease is increasing rapidly.  Chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis are similar in a number of respects.  The treatment of cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis has some similarities.  But chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis also differ in many respects.  The pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis is more clearly related to exogonous factors such as smoking and air pollution than is cystic fibrosis, which is genetically determined.  Clinical differences also exist.  Major differences in treatment between cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis are currently in vogue.  Because of the special problems of adulthood, it is appropriate that many adult patients with cystic fibrosis be cared for by internists who have previously focused their attention on chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  Increased communication between internists and pediatricians on the issue of cystic fibrosis is badly needed today.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lymphocytes from adults homozygous or heterozygous for cystic fibrosis show biochemical abnormalities when cultured for 48 hours in the presence of phytohemagglutinin and autologous serum. In contrast to the 45 per cent increase in total protein and beta-glucuronidase concentrations seen in healthy control subjects when measured per 10(10) cells, both concentrations decreased by 1 per cent in adults heterozygous for cystic fibrosis and by 18 per cent in adults homozygous for cystic fibrosis. The abnormal response of the lymphocytes from persons with cystic fibrosis was due to a serum factor and not to any intrinsic abnormality of the lymphocytes. An abnormal response to hytohemagglutinin occurred in only 14 per cent of 44 healthy control subjects, but in 100 per cent of 14 adults homozygous for cystic fibrosis and in 85 per cent of 26 adults presumed to be heterozygous for cystic fibrosis. As a result of this phenomenon, lymphocytic beta-glucuronidase concentrations were significantly lower than normal in patients with cystic fibrosis when the cells were cultured with phytohemagglutinin and autologous serum. The demonstration of this phenomenon in both homozygotes and presumed heterozygotes (parents) suggests a relationship to the genetic defect in cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

       " 'Increased fertility of heterozygotes with respect to decreased foetal loss among offspring of heterozygotes has been proposed by several authors as a possible explanation for the high gene frequency of CF, TSD and PKU in certain populations. Studies comparing reproductive outcome of heterozygotes with reproductive performance in the general population or in special control groups have been done on several occasions. These studies, however, are known to be heavily biased, on the one side by the fact that ascertainment of heterozygotes through affected offspinrg will tend to underestimate the relative frequency of smaller families, and on the other side because of the inadequacy of census data for comparison and the biases inherent in selection of control families. Careful analysis of the biases involved provides suggestions for proper corrections. From this a method has been developed which offers a better approach to the study of heterozygote fertility in those autosomal recessive conditions which lack a test for direct heterozygote detection.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis was diagnosed after age 13 in 25 patients. All had an elevated sweat chloride and either a sibling with cystic fibrosis or typical pulmonary infection or digestive symptoms caused by exocrine pancreatic deficiency. Fourteen had long-standing pulmonary or digestive symptoms. In contrast, four of eight patients whose symptoms began after age 13 presented with biliary cirrhosis. Three male patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Opacification of all paranasal sinuses was found in all patients examined radiologically. At diagnosis, pulmonary-function testing showed obstructive changes in 19 patients and sputum cultures showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 15 patients. Delayed menarche in five of seven female patients and infertility in the asymptomatic male patient (two of whom were found to have aspermia) could have led to earlier diagnosis. Teenagers and young adults with long-standing pulmonary or digestive symptoms, unexplained cirrhosis, aspermia, or a sibling with cystic fibrosis should be sweat-tested by pilocarpine iontophoresis.\\n',\n",
       " \"The sweat test, even if carried out by an experienced technician, sometimes lacks reproducibility owing presumably to physiological variations (patient's diet, temperature, and other factors at present unrecognized). Some patients are particularly prone to exhibit this variability and in them a single sweat test is almost valueless. The aldosterone status is believed to be responsible for a reciprocal relationship between sweat sodium and potassium concentrations: tests done on 8 patients show that a high sweat potassium is associated with a correspondingly lower sodium--a circumstance which must be borne in mind when interpreting a patient's sweat sodium. Of 30 patients presenting with a variety of symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and with sweat sodium ranging from 50 to 75 mEq/1 (50-75 mmol/1), only 4 have proved to have cystic fibrosis after several years of observations; 13 have later been diagnosed as having asthma. The problem of the 'grey area' of uncertainty is aggravated by the heterozygous state which is also associated with a sweat sodium in this range. Repeated sweat tests are indicated if the sweat sodium lies within the 'grey area', and the diagnostic importance accorded the test should diminish as the sodium value approaches this area. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis must remain in doubt unless there is strong supportive clinical evidence.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The average blood serotonin level of 67 children with cystic fibrosis was found to be about twice that of age-matched normal children. There was no corresponding increase in the urinary excretion of 5- hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Children with cystic fibrosis were well able to metabolize serotonin taken by mouth. No significant correlations were found between the blood serotonin level and the platelet count, height, weight, skinfold thickness, and pulmonary function test, 5 out of 44 patients had raised serum IgE levels, and their mean blood serotonin was higher than in those with normal IgE levels. No explanation for this emerged. Comparable findings (raised blood serotonin normal platelet count, normal urinary 5-HIAA) have been reported only in severe mental retardation. Further study of this phenomenon is warranted because (a) a raised blood serotonin level is sufficiently characteristic of cystic fibrosis to explore its use in diagnosis, and (b) it may help to explain the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and (c) the metabolism and function of serotonin.\\n',\n",

Aged 5 years he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia.  In spite of conventional treatment with cloxacillin and colistin he collapsed and died 48 hours after admission.  The heart was not enlarged, but the myocardium showed a grossly abnormal appearance with variations in thickness and extensive areas of firm pale tissue.  Histology of the heart muscle showed very dramatic changes with severe replacement fibrosis distributed patchily through the myocardium.  This similar mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides was shown in both the pancreas and the salivary glands.  There have now been a number of reports of myocardial fibrosis complicating cystic fibrosis.  The case reported by Mukherji et al. and this case are the first in which mucopolysaccharide deposits have been found in the myocardium.  The mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides in our case does not support the hypothesis that cystic fibrosis is simply a genetic acid mucopolysaccharidosis.\\n',\n",

The activities of pancreatic enzymes, and the total and individual bile salt concentrations are presented for the control subjects, and pancreatic enzyme levels in this group are compared with those seen in children with pancreatic insufficiency (cystic fibrosis). The test meal has been designed so that it can be administered to children with suspected gluten, cows' milk, or disaccharide intolerance.

       " \"When a genic disorder is only manifest if there are offending alleles at both loci, as in fibrocystic disease, there is a loss of two abnormal alleles with each affected birth since the homozygotes rarely reproduce.  How is this loss compensated?  How could some 50,000 alleles, which can only survive to convey themselves in effective gametes if they have a normal allelic partner, become established in the British Isles - and how have some half a million or more got into the world currency?  First, migrations and settlements involve the proportion of defective alleles at all loci being conserved, but their variety being increased.  Secondly, there could be a general tendency due to some advantage in health or vitality, which could be manifest by disease resistance, cold resistance, and by any number of physical or psychological mechanisms.  Thirdly, there may be 'compensation' - that is the death of an infant may lead to replacement as a result of which the replacing sib, if surviving, would have a 2/3 chance of being a carrier.  Fourthly, the disease may be maintained by mutation.  Of the four possibilities, three are unrealistic, so that substantial selective advantage of heterozygotes over the last few hundred years must be postulated.\\n\",\n",

Fluorescence polarization measurements indicate that the fluorochrome has a much higher degree of rotational mobility in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts as compared with normal cells.  Temperature dependent transitions in the emission intensity of NBD-PC incorporated in normal fibroblasts are indicated at 17.7 and 21.2 degrees C while the abnormal cell membranes apparently undergo transitions at 8.7 and 13.5 degrees C. These differences might be due to changes in plasma membrane composition and/or organization, in the case of the cystic fibrosis cells.\\n',\n",
       " 'Nine lysomal enzymes and alkaline phosphatase have been assayed with two different ultramicro techniques in the intra- and extracellular space of fibroblast cultures derived from the skin of cystic fibrosis patients, cystic fibrosis carriers, and normals controls, respectively.  Evidence has been obtained for a multiple leakage of lysomal enzymes and of alkaline phosphatase into the medium of fibroblast cultures from cystic fibrosis patients and carriers.  The situation is comparable to a certain extent, to that observed in I-cell-disease (mucolipidosis II).  This multiple leakage results in the decrease of intracellular activity of several lysosomal enzymes in cultures from cystic fibrosis patients and carriers and due to the coordinate regulationof the synthesis of the \"leaky enzymes\" in an overshooting of the intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity in cultures from cystic fibrosis patients.  It also explains the retarded catabolism of certain molecules, such as the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein, in cystic fibrosis cells.  It is speculated that the basic defect in cystic fibrosis leads to abnormal recognition sites on lysosomal enzymes and on alkaline phosphatase, and in consequence to the leakage of those enzymes into the extracellular space.  The present findings allow one to develop methods for the pre- and postnatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with cell cultures, and for the detection of cystic fibrosis carriers with the peripheral blood.\\n',\n",

Despite much research and several promising leads there is no completely reliable test for detecting heterozygotes, nor a test for the identification of the affected homozygous fetus in utero.  Attention is being focused on the value and the means of screening newborn infants.  Pilot studies carried out in the past six years have indicated two main possibilities.  Firstly, the examination of meconium for excess albumin, refined to include immunoelectrophoretic estimation of the albumin alpha-1 antitrypsin ratio, disaccharidases, and lysosomal enzymes.  A second approach is based on the work with a chloride-sensitive electrode, which has been modified recently to give greater precision in measurement of neonatal sweat electrolytes. While the tests available are reasonably accurate, collaborative trials and respiratory could improve their efficiency still further. Nevertheless, any screening test is presumptive only, and there must be an adequate back-up service with a specific validated diagnostic test.\\n',\n",

Two patients did not undergo the procedure and served as control subjects. All patients were characterized as having varying severity of pulmonary involvement. Large central airways were severely obstructed, and older patients had more trapped gas in their lungs. Hypoxemia and large alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure differences [P(A-a)O2] were due to inhomogeneity of alveolar ventilation. Results indicated that up to ten days to two weeks, bronchoscopic bronchial washing may in some instances improve maximal expiratory flow-volume curves and specific airway conductance and decrease P(A-a)O2 towards normal. Distribution of alveolar gas P(A- a)O2 towards normal. Distribution of alveolar gas became more homogeneous. We conclude that bronchoscopic bronchial washing may be effective in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis, by augmentation of their inadequate cleansing function of the conducting airways.\\n',\n",

No abnormalities in cardiac rate or rhythm were observed with the lavages directed by fiberoptic bronchoscope. Fifty-six lavages were performed under general anesthesia with 20 cardiac abnormalities being noted among this group. Subjective improvement was noted in 96% of the 56 patients who had lavage under general anesthesia. Objective improvement was apparent in 45% of the 24 patients who had lavage with the rigid bronchoscope and 64% of the 36 patients who had lavage by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. It is concluded that patients with cystic fibrosis of varying stages of disability can more safety (and with good improvement) have bronchial washouts with the fiber-optic bronchoscope than with either of the other two techniques.\\n',\n",
       " 'The serum from 75% of the patients with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) who had a positive prick test in their skin to at least one or more antigens, together with elevated concentrations of total serum IgE, also gave strong immediate PCA reactions in the baboon skin to Aspergillus fumigatus, bovine serum albumin and egg albumin.  Of the C.F. patients, 37% also had elevated serum specific IgE to A. fumigatus whereas only 8-10% had either raised specific IgE or PCA reaction to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.  Abolition of the PCA activity by incubating the C.F. sera or sputum at 56 degrees C suggested that the reaginic antibody was IgE rather than IgG4.  PCA reactions to a number of allergens could be detected in both the C.F. sputum and saliva.  Several of the C.F. heterozygotes had a strongly positive history of allergy and a significant number of these heterozygotes had an elevated serum total IgE as well as positive PCA to Timothy grass pollen or to D. pteronyssinus similar to the patients with asthma or hay fever.  Three C.F. patients who died gave strong prick test reactions to several allergens and their sera also had raised serum IgE and positive PCA to at least three different allergens, suggesting that immediate hypersensitivity is of some significance in patients with C.F.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis (CF) children had a greater variability of skin prick test response compared with asthmatic children, when the tests were performed on two occasions. This suggests that there is a different cause for the allergy in the two groups, perhaps because the asthmatics have a transient period of susceptibility to sensitization in infancy and the CF children a persistent vulnerability. Amongst the asthmatic children, clinical improvement was associated with loss of some skin prick test reactions, and clinical deterioration with an increase in the number of positive reactions. Thus continuing allergic reactions may maintain a mucosal defect, resulting in a persistence of susceptibility to allergen sensitization, and control of the reactions may re-establish normal mucosal defence mechanisms.\\n',\n",
       " \"The incorporation of fucose to glycoprotein acceptors prepared from the saliva of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients was compared with the incorporation into acceptors from controls. The CF acceptor glycoprotein incorporated significantly more fucose in the presence of either patients' or control plasma. The fucosyl transferase activity in the patients' plasma was not significantly different from controls. Fucosidase activity was similar also for both groups. The protein bands of the acceptor glycoproteins from the patients' saliva differed from those of the control in number and electrophoretic mobility. On the basis of these studies of fucose incorporation we propose that glycoprotein in the salivary secretion of E&Apatients are qualitatively different from normal.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The combined use of special cell culture techniques and biochemical ultramicromethods permits one to handle very small amounts of materials, to reduce the costs of chemicals, and more accurately to assess gene dosage effects by expressing enzyme activities per cell instead of per total cell protein. An alkaline phosphatase induction test has been developed which allows one to screen small numbers of fibroblasts for lysosomal storage diseases, cystic fibrosis, and chromosomal disorders. A successful attempt has been made to automate the microtechniques. Combining the alkaline phosphatase induction with the ultramicro automatization should eventually permit one to screen all pregnancies for major possible fetal genetic defects. Automated ultramicro enzyme assays should contribute to the general development of clinical chemistry.\\n',\n",
       " 'We describe a new method for measuring pancreatic and salivary-type amylases in serum that requires no electrophoresis or chromatography. An inhibitor protein (from wheat) with a 100-fold greater specificity for human salivary than for human pancreatic amylase was used to analyze mixtures of the two enzymes. The concentration of pancreatic and salivary amyalase was determined in 141 normal sera (72 men and 69 women). Statistically significant differences were found for serum pancreatic amylase between mean and women, higher values being shown in women. No sex-related difference was found for the salivary component of serum amylase. With this method, the increase in serum amylase activity in pancreatitis was shown to be attributable to the pancreatic component. In mumps, the increase is attributable to the salivary component. In pancreatic insufficiency, serum pancreatic amylase activities were significantly lower than in the controls. Our method is simple and rapid; our results agree well with those of other authors who used chromatographic or electrophoretic methods.\\n',\n",

Contrary to other reports the medium from cystic fibrosis fibroblasts did not inhibit ATPase activity.\\n',\n",

While stability and reproducibility is good, certain antiseptic systems and especially Hibitaine (chlorhexidine gluconate) interfere with the electrode and therefore need to be absent during sweat testing. Temperature conditions during calibration and sweat testing need to be controlled in view of the extent of response variations for even modest temperature differences between sensor-skin interface and electrode stem.\\n',\n",
       " 'Using a micro-method for the determination of plasma arginine esterase activity, we have investigated the values for soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI)-inhibited arginine esterase activity in patients with cystic fibrosis, obligate heterozygotes and age matched control individuals. The mean of STI-inhibited activity is lowest for cystic fibrosis patients while the mean for normal controls is the highest. The mean of STI-inhibited activity for the heterozygotes is midway between the values of the patients and the normal individuals. The deficiency of arginine esterase activity was statistically significant for both cystic fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.\\n',\n",
       " 'The complex of trypsin with purified alpha2-macroglobulin from normals and patients with cystic fibrosis was studied. The formed complex failed to reveal any proteolytic activity toward a high molecular weight substrate whereas the esterolytic activity towards a low molecular weight substrate was retained. This esterolytic activity was resistant to inhibition by a high molecular weight inhibitor. During iincubation at 38 degrees C the complex with normal alpha2-macroglobulin was slowly inhibited by the high molecular weight inhibitor and regained activity with the high molecular weight substrate. This phenomenon was not obtained when the alpha2- macroglobulin from cystic fibrosis was examined. These data suggest that the gradual conversion of normal alpha2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex into an alpha2-macroglobulin fragment-trypsin complex is deficient in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

A carefully organized, staged approach to diagnosis will provide the best method of identifying those infants in whom a specific aetiology exists and for whom specific therapy is often available. Regardless of aetiology, however, the early use of appropriate nutritional support will not only reduce morbidity and mortality in these infants, but will prevent the development of many of the secondary consequences of malnutrition.

       " 'Pancreatic development begins during the fourth week of gestation. In annular pancreas, the ventral pancreas fails to migrate to the right of the duodenum.  Duplication of the pancreatic ducts is a rare entity, probably arising from accidental misplacement of mucosal cells from the duodenum or stomach during the development of the pancreatic pouches.  Congenital pancreatic cysts may be single, multiple, unilocular or multilocular and can be associated with polycystic disease of the kidney, liver or spleen.  Ectopic pancreas occurs before or during the rotation of the ventral pancreas and its fusion with the dorsal pancreas.  Few tumours of the pancreas have been reported in children less than 15 years of age.  The evaluation of patients via different pancreatic function tests is significant only when the results are interpreted in the light of clinical manifestations.  Tests of exocrine pancreatic function in childhood include stool examination, the triolein test, blood examination, analysis of duodenal contents, the secretin-pancreozymin test, pancreatic scanning with selenomethionine, transduodenal pancreatogram, abdominal ultrasound and arteriography, and upper gastrointestinal x-ray.  The most prevalent disorder of the pancreas in infancy and childhood is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  Well over 96 per cent of infants and children with pancreatic insufficiency have cystic fibrosis.  Shwachman syndrome is the second most common cause of pancreatic insufficiency and is associated with neutropenia, metaphyseal dystosis, sever stunting of growth, eczema, and susceptibility to infections.  Patients with cystic fibrosis who have partial pancreatic insufficiency sometimes show dissociation of different enzyme activities.  Although pancreatitis is comparatively rare in infancy and childhood, we suspect that it is often overlooked.\\n',\n",
       " 'We suggest that the intrauterine detection of cystic fibrosis may be based on the investigation of the amniotic fluid.  It is known that the protein content of the meconium of homozygotic newborn infants is significantly increased, whereas that of heterozygotic infants is only moderately increased.  As a result of intrauterine intestinal activity, the bowel content may be excreted into the amniotic fluid; thus a detectable deviation in the protein content of amniotic fluid may be expected.  We decided to determine the total protein content and the amount of acid-soluble glycoproteins in 86 amniotic fluid samples, both by polography and by measuring the hexose content.  In the homozygous case a slight increase was observed in total protein content, whereas in the heterozygous cases no changes were observed.\\n',\n",
       " 'A group of 102 obligate heterozygotes for the cystic fibrosis gene were examined for genetic type of pancreatic isoamylases as well as enzyme activity of pancreatic iso-amylases, salivary isoamylases and total amylase in serum. The analysis was performed using electrophoretic separation for detection of the various types of isoamylases, and their relative activity was determined by means of densitometry. The activities of salivary isoamylases and total amylase in serum showed no significant differences between the cystic fibrosis heterozygotes and a control group. The frequency of the variant gene for pancreatic isoamylase was also the same as in the controls. The mean value for pancreatic isoamylase was slightly higher in the cystic fibrosis heterozygotes than in the control group (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.02).\\n',\n",
       " 'Bioassays using ciliary systems have detected a factor or factors in cystic fibrosis (CF) sera and tissue culture medium derived from CF cells. The typical shortcomings of an assay measuring biological activity have been studied, and the means to overcome the weaknesses of the oyster gill cilia assay have been established. The presence of the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor (CFMI) in experimental fractions may be determined by accepting data from only those assays in which authentic CF and normal (non-CF) fractions give defined reactions, by measuring the reaction of each sample at least three times, and by examining each experimental sample at a protein concentration greater than the minimum established in this study. The relative concentrations of the CFMI present in the first steps of purification of serum and medium have been calculated in terms of units of inhibition. Generally, the units of inhibition present in serum and medium fractions from heterozygotes are close to one-half of that in fractions from homozygous sources. Analogous fractions concentrated from a normal (non-CF) source never inhibited mucociliary activity, even when tested at nearly 100 times the CF concentration. Ciliary assays utilizing oyster gills are essential for monitoring fractionation procedures aimed at purifying the CFMI, and have been shown to be capable and reliable enough to do so.\\n',\n",
       " 'Although the majority of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) show a typical clinical course, a minority with the same clinical phenotype at the time of initial diagnosis have an atypical (mild) course. Skin fibroblast cultures were established from 49 members of the family of one such atypical CF adult patient, previously identified (Danes et al. 1976) as CF Class II (ametachromatic and no metabolic cooperation with CF Class I fibroblasts), the offspring of Class I (metachromatic, metabolic cooperation with normal fibroblasts)/Class II mating. The culture phenotype for Class I was traced on the maternal side and for Class II on the paternal side through consecutive generations and the culture phenotype of each class segregated. This family study added experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the atypical (mild) clinical features and course of this adult CF patient were due to two different CF genes combining to produce a genetic compound expressing a mild form of CF.\\n',\n",

In patients with other diseases who are treated with chloramphenicol, the risk of devastating bone marrow toxicity has been estimated to range from 1:40,000 to 1:100,000.  We have found only two reports of patients with CF who had hematologic complications after treatment with chloramphenicol.

       " 'The five major diseases of the pancreas together make a significant contribution to morbidity and mortality among the people of the United States. These diseases are diabetes, cystic fibrosis, acute and chronic pancreatitis, and carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas. Four of these diseases can be modeled in laboratory animals by acute or chronic administration of chemical poisons or carcinogens. Human pancreatic diseases attributed to the effect of chemical agents including alcohol and drugs include many cases of chronic pancreatitis and some cases of acute pancreatitis. The cause is not known in many cases of human pancreatitis, including interstitial, acute, and chronic clinical forms. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the increasing incidence of carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas in the United States may reflect chemical carcinogenesis. On the basis of experimental observations, we know that pancreatic islet cells can be damaged directly by toxic chemicals, and that islet cell tumors can be chemically induced. Thus, there is adequate background data to conclude that several pancreatic diseases of obscure etiology may be due in part to hitherto unidentified toxic effects of chemical agents encountered in personal or general environments.\\n',\n",
       " 'In 21 children with cystic fibrosis, the vectorcardiogram (VCG) was correlated with various indices of the severity of the disease. The best correlation was found between (1) the azimuth angle of the spatial QRS loop area, representing the rightward and posterior shift of the main electrical forces, and pulmonary function tests (PFT): FEV1 % predicted (r = -0.671, P less than 0.005) and VC% predicted (r = -0.607, P less than 0.005), and (2) the right ventricular anterior wall index measured echocardiographically (r = 0.472, P less than 0.05). More VCG parameters correlated significantly with PFT than with the echocardiogram. This shows the major influence of pulmonary changes on the VCG of those patients. In several subgroups with different clinical scores, the VCG were analyzed and compared to normal limits of age- and sex-matched controls. In this small series, the VCG was a specific but not very sensitive method for predicting the degree of severity of the disease. Echocardiography and vectorcardiography can be considered as two complementary techniques in the evaluation of cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

These \"fast isoamylases\" are generated, at least in part, by deamidation. Compared with juvenile and adult controls, a significantly greater number of \"fast isoamylases\" was found in the parotid saliva of children with cystic fibrosis and their healthy heterozygous parents. A shift in the equilibrium between amidation and deamidation is discussed in terms of its possible connection with the metabolic defect responsible for cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have previously demonstrated that cystic fibrosis (CF) cells show increased survival compared to normal cells when exposed to ouabain in medium lacking potassium.  In this report, we show that the CF cells bind significantly less ouabain than the normal cells in potassium-deficient medium.  Using age-matched normal and CF skin fibroblast strains, we show that (1) at ouabain concentrations < 20x10-9 M binding for both normal and CF cells is linear with time for 1 h and reaches equilibrium after 4 h; (2) at ouabain concentrations between 2 and 20x10-9 M, the initial rate of binding for CF cells is approx. 70% of the normal cells; (3) under equilibrium-binding conditions, Scatchard analysis reveals that three different CF strains have 12, 16, and 44% fewer ouabain-binding sites than their matched normal controls.  In addition, studies in potassium-free medium of the inhibition of 86Rb flux (a K-plus analogue) into the cell by ouabain show no differences between CF and normal cells.  We have also previously shown that in a low glucose, potassium-deficient medium the CF cells survived ouabain exposure no better than normal cells.  In this report, equilibrium-binding studies with [3H]ouabain clearly show that CF cells bind less ouabain under these conditions than normal cells.  These results indicate that ouabain resistance in CF cells is not solely a function of differences in ouabain binding. Furthermore, the differential ouabain killing may not be due to ion transport differences, but rather to as yet unknown mechanisms.  CF cells thus appear to be unlike previously characterized ouabain-resistant mutants.\\n',\n",

       " 'This study was undertaken because of reports of a marked increase in fecal bile acid excretion by children with cystic fibrosis. We attempted to confirm this finding by performing [1-14C]cholylglycine breath tests and by measuring fecal bile acid and fat excretion in patients with cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency. Studies were done when patients were taking pancreatic enzymes (Cotazym) and also without medication. 14CO2 excretion in breath was normal in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency and even lower in cystic fibrosis, both with and without Cotazym therapy. Fecal bile acid excretion was slightly elevated in both groups without Cotazym and became normal with Cotazym in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency. Steatorrhea was present in both patient groups and improved during Cotazym therapy. Bile acid malabsorption in cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency is minimal and probably not clinically important.\\n',\n",
       " 'Roller and Kern report that bile acid malabsorption in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and acquired pancreatic insufficiency is minimal.  These findings are at variance with other studies and deserve comment.  In the absence of fecal bile acid values in controls, the authors cannot state that levels in CF are only twice normal values, especially since the papers cited on normal bile acid excretion refer to measurements obtained by a different technique. We also question the validity of the breath test as an index of bile acid malabsorption in CF.  Our recent report shows that in 8 older CF (mean age 12.1 years) the magnitude of bile acid loss in the stools was comparable to that of the younger age group (mean age 3.9 years) and that there was no correlation between the age and the degree of bile acid loss.  On the other hand, we must take issue with Roller and Kern when they suggest that bile acid malabsorption in CF is probably not clinically important.  Our findings not only bear relevance to the intestinal manifestations of CF and to the increased incidence of cholelithiasis but perhaps also to the early deposition within the intrahepatic ducts of eosinophilic mucus concretions proposed as the cause of biliary cirrhosis in this disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Twelve patients with meconium ileus equivalent complicating cystic fibrosis in the postneonatal period were seen at the Mayo Clinic in the years 1950 through 1975. In a child or young adult with known or suspected cystic fibrosis, the triad of recurrent colicky abdominal pain, a mass in the right lower quadrant, and mechanical intestinal obstruction provides a clue to diagnosis of meconium ileus equivalent. The clinical suspicion of meconium ileus equivalent may be confirmed by meglumine diatrizoate (Gastrografin) enema, which in most uncomplicated cases also serves as treatment.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bile acid kinetics was investigated by stable isotope dilution technique in 6 children (ages 3 1/2 months to 4 1/2 years) with previously untreated cystic fibrosis.  All of the patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of malabsorption, normal intestinal mucosal function, as judged by glucose absorption, intestinal histology, disaccharidase levels, and normally functioning gallbladders.  The children were maintained on a constant diet throughout the study period; fat intake averaged 4.2 g per kg per day.  Before administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement, fat excretion equalled 50 plus or minus 4% (mean plus or minus SE) of intake and was reduced to 20 plus or minus 1.0% of intake after therapy.  Total bile acid pool size nearly doubled during enzyme replacement from 379 plus or minus 32 micromoles per kg to 620 plus or minus 36 micromoles per kg with secondary bile acids comprising 57% of the total pool before therapy and 40% after therapy.  Total bile acid synthesis changed little with therapy, equalling 139 plus or minus 17 micromoles per kg per day (total 602 plus or minus 109 mg per day) without enzyme replacement and 125 plus or minus 19 micromoles per kg per day (total 470 plus or minus 86 milligrams per day) with enzyme replacement.  This was confirmed by the fecal excretion of bile acids: 545 plus or minus 166 milligrams of bile acid per day were excreted without enzymes as compared to 513 plus or minus 146 milligrams per day with enzymes. After therapy, the fractional turnover rate of the bile acid pool was reduced from 0.602 plus or minus 0.05 per day to 0.233 plus or minus .03 per day for cholic acidand from 0.696 plus or minus 0.09 per day to 0.39 plus or minus 0.04 per day for chenodeoxycholic acid.  These data indicate that both primary and secondary bile acids are conserved within the enterohepatic circulation during enzyme therapy, and that the mechanism for the regulation of hepatic bile acid synthesis is intact in cystic fibrosis.  However, the demonstration that large amounts of bile acid continue to be excreted during therapy suggests that interruption of the enterohepatic circulation continues and that deficiencies of the intraluminal phase may persist during enzyme therapy in this disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'The survival rates in 204 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis observed between January 1956 and June 1976 were recorded. The patients were divided into five groups according to the symptoms present at the time of diagnosis and survival rates were recorded separately for each group. Survival was less good in the group of patients presenting initially with pulmonary symptoms compared to the group presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. In the group presenting with meconium ileus survival was poor initially, but later in the course of the disease it became similar to that observed in the other groups. The differences in survival between the different categories occurred during the first two years after diagnosis. The study shows that, on clinical grounds, a severe form of the disease which is characterized by early manifestation of pulmonary symptoms and poor survival can be distinguished from a more protracted form with a better survival. Because of the great inter-individual variability large numbers of patients will have to be evaluated in order to achieve statistically significant results in studies which attempt to compare different therapeutic approaches. If such numbers cannot be reached, it may be necessary to compare only patients who belong to the same symptomatic category.\\n',\n",
       " '31 children with cystic fibrosis (CF) subdivided into three groups of age were studied before and after treatment with lyophilized pancreas and compared to 27 controls. CF was characterized by lower phospholipid, cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid plasma concentrations and reduced coefficient of fat absorption. Treatment tended towards normalization of these values. With age polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in normals but not in CF. The significant correlations existing between fat absorption coefficient and polyunsaturated fatty acid percentage in neutral lipids of CF children suggests the use of the latter percentage as index of the stage of malabsorption.\\n',\n",

The increase in the frequency of first cousin marriage relative to that of the general population is much greater, as expected, in cystinosis, which is a rare disease, than in cystic fibrosis, which is the most frequent recessive disorder in France. Inbreeding in cystinosis and cystic fibrosis was also studied by computing the distance between parental birth places. This distance is smaller in cystinosis than in cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'The apparent frequency of the recessive autosomal allele for cystic fibrosis (cf) is too high to be satisfactorily explained by mutation equilibrium. However, higher reproductive fitness by heterozygotes (expressed by t greater than 0) or higher gametic viability of the cf allele (expressed by a greater than 0.5) can provide reasonable explanations of the present frequency. Furthermore, birth replacement in families with CF children (RPE) can account for the estimated historical values of t. Today, however, t is probably at or approaching zero as a result of discontinuation of RPE. In the future we can look for an imperceptibly slow decrease in the incidence of CF. Reproduction by CF females will not cause an increase in incidence; it will only slightly slow the rate of decrease.\\n',\n",

       " \"The carotid bodies from 71 patients ranging in age from 28 weeks' gestation to 30 years were obtained at autopsy. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of chronic hypoxemia. There was a high correlation between the weight of individual carotid bodies in each case. Among the 12 patients with chronic hypoxemia, eight patients had carotid bodies heavier than predicted by statistical analysis. Of these eight patients, six had cystic fibrosis and two had cyanotic heart disease. Morphometric and cell population analyses of the carotid bodies from these eight patients and from those of the control population indicated that enlargement of the carotid bodies during normal or abnormal growth results from proportionate increases in lobule parenchyma and stroma. There was also an increase in the width and length of the lobules without an increase in the diameter of the cell cords or a change in the size or proportion of the chief cells. Growth and development of the carotid bodies were studied in a control group of 59 patients without chronic hypoxemia. There were no sex related differences in carotid body weights. The combined weight of the carotid bodies correlated most strongly with body weight, although there was some correlation with age and body length. A regression equation reflecting the data relating to body weight (BW) is: Combined weight of carotid bodies (in mg.) = 0.29 BW (in kg.) +3.0.

       " 'Phospholipase A2, lysolecithinase, and lysolecithin-lysolecithin acyltransferase are present in the airway secretions of patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and alveolar proteinosis.  Assays of these enzymes under the same conditions in extracts of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, and pig tracheal mucosa indicated that these extracellular airway enzymes were probably not derived from these cell types.  Although the above three enzymes were present in secretions of all patients with these three diseases, large amounts of palmitoyl lysolecithin, free fatty acids, and dipalmitoyl lecithin were found only in patients having alveolar proteinosis and asthma.  The amount of free fatty acids in these secretions was sufficient to inhibit both the lysolecithinase and the lysolecithin-lysolecithin acyltransferase, but not the phospholipase A2.  These findings suggest that the large amount of dipalmitoyl lecithin, free fatty acids, and lysolecithin found in these secretions results from extracellular remodelling by these enzymes.  Because the phospholipase A2 was present in large amounts, it was possible after delipidation to purify it to homogeneity.

The study was confined to the years of birth 1961-1965. On a total of 1,239,566 live births 342 infants and children were found to have CF (1/3600). A list of all studies on the frequency of CF in Caucasian populations is presented as an appendix. A seasonal trend in the expression of the CF gene at birth (either with or without meconium ileus) was noted.\\n',\n",
       " 'Because immediate hypersensitivity reactions can occur in individuals exposed to powdered pancreatic extracts, 36 patients with cystic fibrosis and 51 patents of such patients wwer studied for evidence of sensitization. Sensitivity to the extracts as evidence by history and skin testing was infrequent in the children with cystic fibrosis. However, skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity with either crude pancreatic extracts or inactivated trypsin correlated well in their patents with a history of clinical symptoms. IgE mediation of these reactions in sensitized individuals was demonstrated by antigen- induced histamine release from leukocytes, passive transfer studies, and immediate response to inhalation challenge.\\n',\n",
       " 'The oral conditions of 42 patients being treated for cystic fibrosis were evaluated. The patients were grouped by age and, in some aspects, were compared with a small control group of their siblings. The patient group had a lowered incidence of plaque and less gingival disease than did the control group in which every person had some amount of plaque or gingival disease. Calculus formation was minimal. The reasons for the finding of minimal plaque in the patient group could be related to several factors, including the life-long use of various antibiotic agents, the chewing of digestive enzyme supplements, the effect of medical management on tooth hardness, and the effect of stained teeth (possible tetracycline deposition) on the plaque microorganisms. It appears that the therapy for cystic fibrosis was beneficial to the periodontal health of these patients. Much further study is needed to understand the interrelationship between an altered oral environment (salivary changes in cystic fibrosis), altered microbial flora (by antibiotics, enzymes) and even altered tooth surfaces (possible tetracycline deposition). Most patients were found to have one or more oral habits. Tooth mobility was associated with tension habits. Patients who had clubbed fingers (indicating pulmonary compromise) and possibly a severe disease process, did not appear to have either stained teeth or the severity of the gingivitis associated with this. The relationship of tetracycline to tooth staining could not be pinpointed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Theoretical relationships among a number of parameters were derived for idealized timed vital capacity (TVC) and maximal expiratory flow- volume (MEFV) curves to determine a minimal set of independent parameters. Normal pediatric subjects and those with cystic fibrosis were studied to verify these relationships experimentally. The average flow over the middle half (FEF25-75%) of the forced vital capacity (FVC) and flows at various exhaled percentages of the FVC (FEF50%, FEF75%), as well as moments of the TVC and MEFV curves were computed. From the TVC moments, a mean transit time (MTT) and an index of dispersion (ID) were also calculated. The minimum information needed to detect pulmonary mechanical changes associated with obstructive lung disease requires at least two reproducible measures: one related to the mean slope (e.g., FEF25-75%/FVC or MTT) and the other to the shape (e.g;, ID) of the effort-independent portion of the MEFV curve.\\n',\n",
       " 'Alpha-2-macroglobulin was purified from plasma obtained from three healthy controls and three patients with cystic fibrosis.  The normal and patient preparations were indistinguishable antigenically and in their UV absorption spectra.  Competitive inhibition by these preparations of the hydrolysis of benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester by bovine trypsin was observed.  The Ki value for normal alpha-2-macroglobulin was 5.3 x 10-8 M as compared to 1.8 x 10-7 M for cystic fibrosis patients preparations.  The km values of the alpha-2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex were 6.3 x 10-4 M for the normal protein and 1.5 x 10-4 M with the alpha-2-macroglobulin from the cystic fibrosis patients.  Gel chromatography of normal alpha-2-macroglobulin, preincubated in molar ratios with bovine trypsin, revealed the formation of alpha-2-macroglobulin fragments. These fragments were not obtained with the preparations from the cystic fibrosis patients.  Both the normal and cystic fibrosis alpha-2-macroglobulins were shown by gel chromatography in sodium dodecyl sulfate to be tetramers, noncovalently bound.  After reduction and alkylation the monomers were found to be a single polypeptide chain.  The fragments obtained by preincubating normal alpha-2-macroglobulin with trypsin had approximately half the molecular weight of the intact monomer.  Cystic fibrosis alpha-2-macroglobulin preincubated with trypsin in sodium dodecyl sulfate a single major component identical to the intact monomers, with no formation of alpha-2-macroglobulin fragments.\\n',\n",
       " 'The role of vitamin E in human nutrition was studied by investigation of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and associated pancreatic insufficiency.  Vitamin E status was assessed by measurement of the plasma concentration of the principal circulating isomer, alpha-tocopherol.  Results of such determinations in 52 CF patients with pancreatogenic steatorrhea revealed that all were deficient in the vitamin.  The extent of decreased plasma tocopherol varied markedly but correlated with indices of intestinal malabsorption, such as the serum carotene concentration and percentage of dietary fat absorbed.  Supplementation with 5-10 times the recommended daily allowance of vitamin E in a water-miscible form increased the plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations to normal in all 19 CF patients so evaluated. Studies on the effects of vitamin E deficiency focused on possible hematologic alterations.  An improved technique was developed to measure erythrocyte hemolysis in vitro in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.  While erythrocyte suspensions from control subjects demonstrated resistance to hemolysis during a 3-h incubation, all samples from tocopherol-deficient CF patients showed abnormal oxidant susceptibility, evidenced by greater than 5% hemoglobin release.  The degree of peroxide-induced hemolysis was related to the plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrationin an inverse, sigmoidal manner.  The possibility of in vivo hemolysis was assessed by measuring the survival of 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes in 19 vitamin-E deficient patients.  A moderate but statistically significant decrease in the mean 51Cr erythrocyte half-life value was found in this group.  Measurement of erythrocyte survival before and after supplementation of 6 patients with vitamin E demonstrated that the shortened erythrocyte lifespan could be corrected to normal with this treatment.  Other hematologic indices in deficient subjects, however, were normal and did not change upon supplementation with vitamin E.  It is concluded that CF is invariably associated with vitamin E deficiency, provided that the patient in question has pancreatic achylia and is not taking supplementary doses of tocopherol.  Concomitant hematologic effects consistent with mild hemolysis, but not anemia, occur and may be reversed with vitamin E therapy.  Patients with CF should be given daily doses of a water-miscible form of vitamin E to correct the deficiency.\\n',\n",

Thirty-six adult patients of bronchiectasis proved by bronchography was investigated for mucoviscidosis.  If a patient had sweat chloride above 60 mEq./l., it was considered to be diagnostic of mucoviscidosis.  Five (13.9 per cent) of 36 adult bronchiectasis patients had mucoviscidosis.  The mean value of sweat chloride in 31 adult bronchiectasis patients was 32.9 plus or minus 11.7 mEq./l. The mean value of sweat chloride in 36 adult bronchiectasis patients (including 5 mucoviscidosis patients) was 42.3 plus or minus 26.8 mEq./l.

In recruitment, families who knew the study team, who were professionally involved, and/or who were under close continuing care were more likely to volunteer for such studies than those who were unfamiliar with the team or institution. Antibody responses and systemic reactions occurred more often after administration of inactivated whole-virus vaccine than after split-virus vaccine. Significant titers (greater than or equal to 1:40) of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to A/NJ/76 virus occurred in 95% of normal children three to 18 years of age who received two doses of the same vaccine (whole or split).

There were no statistically significant differences in either reactivity or humoral antibody response among the 167 children in seven chronic disease categories and 86 healthy children. The whole-virus vaccines were associated with unacceptably high rates of reaction when given in sufficiently antigenic initial doses but were relatively nonreactive when used for booster immunization. Split-product vaccines were no more reactive than placebo. All vaccine preparations induced adequate seroconversion rates and protective titers of antibody to A/Victoria virus after one dose and to A/New Jersey virus after two doses.\\n',\n",
       " 'The disposition of methicillin in normal subjects and in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) was studied after administration of single intravenous doses of 15 mg/kg. The area under the serum concentration vs. time curve for CF patients was, on the average, only 75% of that found for normal subjects. The low concentrations in serum were caused by more rapid urinary excretion of the antibiotic, with rates of renal clearance averaging 425 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the patients with CF and 362 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the normal subjects. No differences were found in volumes of distribution and metabolic clearance rates of methicillin or in rates of creatinine clearance between the two groups of subjects. These data support previous findings with dicloxacillin which show that patients with CF exhibit unusually rapid, active tubular secretion of certain penicillins that may necessitate use of larger doses of these drugs in treatment of infections.\\n',\n",
       " 'Previous investigators have suggested that the biological activity of plasma prekallikrein is defective in cystic fibrosis. In contrast, no such difference was demonstrable between normal and cystic fibrosis plasma. Esterolytic activity for the synthetic substrate p-toluene sulfonyl-arginine methyl ester (TAMe) evolved normally in cystic fibrosis plasma treated with chloroform and ellagic acid, a measure of generation of plasma kallikrein. Additionally, plasma prekallikrein (Fletcher factor) and high molecular weight kininogen (Fitzgerald factor), a substrate of plasma kallikrein, were normal. Thus, the concept that cystic fibrosis is associated with abnormalities in the plasma kallikrein-kinin system could not be supported.\\n',\n",

There were no differences in density which was in most polyps less than 0.5 gland/mm.2. The shape and architecture as well as other histological appearances of the polyp were also alike in both groups of polyps which could not be distinguished. The pathogenesis of nasal polyps in cystic fibrosis is discussed. Apparently, it is the same as that of non-cystic-fibrosis polyps.\\n',\n",
       " 'The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone was observed in two patients with cystic fibrosis during acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease. It was diagnosed by the accepted clinical and laboratory criteria and confirmed in one case by values for immunoreactive vasopressin that were inappropriately high for plasma osmolality. The severe hyponatremia was corrected by fluid restriction, alone or combined with intravenous treatment with diuretic and hypertonic saline solution. In addition, there was simultaneous therapy of the pulmonary disease. SIADH thus must be added to salt loss as a cause of hyponatremia in CF, and may be more common than realized in patients with CF and severe pulmonary disease.\\n',\n",

Topical application of normal serum or of CF serum did not inhibit in vivo nasal MCC. Induction of local inflammation by topical anti-IgE- reduced nasal MCC in CF subjects, but increased MCC in normal individuals. Furthermore, nasal MCC was inhibited in normal patients by CF serum but not normal serum, applied to the anti-IgE-treated nasal mucosa. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that CF serum inhibits MCC in vivo in the inflamed mucosa.\\n',\n",
       " 'The pharmacokinetic variables of amikacin were measured in 20 children  and adolescents, four to 16 years of age.  The mean plasma clearance of amikacin was 120 ml/minute/1.73 m2.  The major route of elimination was renal (82%).  Simultaneously measured inulin clearance showed that a majority (64%) of the drug filtered by the kidneys was excreted in the urine.  The mean volume of distribution of amikacin was 32% of body weight; half-life during the final (pseudoequilibrium) phase averaged 1.6 hours.  No significant accumulation of the drug was seen when four doses were given intravenously at 420 mg/m2 every 8 hours; the plasma concentration just before injection of the fourth dose averaged 2.4 plus or minus 1.1 microgram/ml.  The mean plasma concentration at 60 to 75 minutes after injection of the drug was 28.7 microg/ml with little interpatient variation (SD 3.5 microg/ml).  When the dose was expressed in terms of milligrams per kilogram, it was found that children often needed 50 to 100% more of the drug, compared to adults, to achieve equivalent plasma concentrations; this larger requirement was primarily due to a higher clearance of amikacin in proportion to body weight.  Dosages based on surface area, however, resulted in uniform requirements and predictable plasma concentrations in all patients studied.\\n',\n",

       " 'The relationship between the dosage of pancreatic extract and the excretion of uric acid was investigated in 29 patients with cystic fibrosis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Urinary excretion of uric acid was normal in patients receiving small doses of pancreatic extracts and abnormally high in those receiving large amounts. In the latter group, normouricosuria was achieved by reducing the dose of pancreatic extract. Normal stool patterns and adequate weight gains were preserved by a diet modification that was well accepted by the patients. To eliminate the potential renal consequences of hyperuricosuria, it seems appropriate to control the need for increasing amounts of pancreatic enzymes by limiting the dietary intake of fat and maintaining a positive caloric and nitrogen balance with high intake of protein and carbohydrates and supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides.\\n',\n",
       " \"The possibility has been raised that complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  This impairment would be consistent with the thesis that the alternative pathway had been activated in vivo and, therefore, depleted.  The purpose of this work is to explore further the function of the alternative pathway in cystic fibrosis.  Examination of the data using Student's t test and analysis of variance showed no significant difference in the mean hemolytic activity of sera of CF patients as compared to the control group.  The data presented do not support the work of Polley and Bearn who demonstrated an abnormality in CF patients using conversion of C3 by inulin as assay.  The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.  Our results do not preclude in vivo activation of the alternative pathway, since a compensatory increase in synthesis of components could offset component consumption.  Since the net result is a completely normal level of activity, however, it does not seem likely that significant consumption has occurred.\\n\",\n",

We wish to report an infant with CF in which liver biopsy showed features typical of neonatal giant cell hepatitis.  In our patient, none of the pathologic features usually described in CF were present in either of the biopsies. Rather, the changes were those described in neonatal hepatitis and, to our knowledge, have not been reported in association with CF.  It is likely that the giant cell hepatitis was a coincidental finding, unrelated to CF.  It emphasizes, however, that one cannot assume a uniform etiology for all instances of obstructive jaundice seen in infants with CF.\\n',\n",

There is no significant increase in the Vmax of CF fibroblasts as compared to values obtained for control cells.  We conclude that with our growth and assay conditions, in which we attempted to duplicate those described in the original investigation, there is no consistent or significant increase in the Vmax of putrescine uptake in CF fibroblasts.\\n',\n",

       " 'The University of Kansas group have established that pancreatic extracts, in the doses currently used in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis, cause hyperuricosuria which may occasionally be symptomatic.  They correctly worry about long-term ill effects of such therapy.  In treated CF patients the uricosuria results primarily from the increased dietary purine load, though the abnormal transport physiology in CF may contribute.  Even though final evidence on risk is not at hand, prudence would suggest holding the purine load in CF patients to the minimum needed to ensure digestion of sufficient foodstuffs without necessarily permitting a \"normal\" diet sans steatorrhea.  Alternatively, purified enzyme preparations free of the remaining sweetbread could eliminate the excess nucleic acid intake and be administered in a dosage permitting the luxury of redundant safety.\\n',\n",
       " 'After reading \"The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone [ADH] secretion [SIADH] as a cause of hyponatremia in cystic fibrosis [CF],\" we are puzzled by certain unusual phenomena in the two cases presented.  We agree that it would be important to recognize the occurrence of ADH mediated hyponatremia in CF.  We would, though, appreciate the authors\\' comments on the weight losses and the fluid and electrolyte balances early in these patients\\'s courses.  Also helpful would be information on furosemide dosage and any other drugs, such as acetaminophen, which may have been given so we can further understand the pathophysiology of these two complex patients. - We do not think there was hypovolemia in either case.  Patient 1 was given only one dose of 600 mg of acetaminophen on the fourth day of hospitalization during recovery.  Patient 2 received only one dose of acetaminophen (650 mg) at 2 AM on the twenty-first day of admission after recovery.  Both patients were receiving antibiotics and Patient 2 was receiving digitalis as well.  The reason for production of ADH remains obscure as it is in most cases of SIADH, although it was mentioned in the discussion that the transient nature of SIADH in these patients with cystic fibrosis would argue against the production of this hormone in the lung.\\n',\n",

Two groups of patients were identified; Group I (N=6) whose OGTT was entirely normal and Group II (N=7) who had some abnormality in glucose during OGTT. In each group basal glucagon concentrations were normal and supressed appropriately (p less than 0.05) after glucose; insulin responses were attenuated and the peak responses delayed. During arginine stimulation, insulin secretion was impaired in each group. However, glucagon secretion was diminished only in Group II. Thus, insulinopenia was found in both groups and hyperglucagonemia was not found as a contributory factor to the hyperglycemia in Group II.\\n',\n",

Severity of the underlying disease was the most important determinant of response to treatment. Ticarcillin- resistant organisms were recovered during treatment in 50% of patients who received this drug; recovery of them was not prevented by the inclusion of gentamicin in the therapeutic regimen nor did they interfere with clinical improvement. The ticarcillin-resistant strains persisted at follow-up, two to six months after completion of therapy, in only one of ten patients. No serious toxicity to ticarcillin was noted during the study period.\\n',\n",

       " 'The single envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus was used as a specific probe of glycosyltransferase activities in fibroblasts from two cystic fibrosis patients, an obligate heterozygous carrier and a normal individual. Gel filtration of pronase-digested glycopeptides from both purified virions and infected cell-associated VSV glycoprotein which had been labeled with[3H] glucosamine did not reveal any significant differences in the glycosylation patterns between the different cell cultures. All 4 cell lines were apparently able to synthesize the mannose- and glucosamine- containing core structure and branch chains terminating in sialic acid which are characteristic of asparagine-linked carbohydrate side chains in cellular glycoproteins. Analysis of tryptic glycopeptides by anion-exchange chromotography indicated that the same 2 major sites on the virus polypeptide were recognized and glycosylated in all 4 VSV-infected cell cultures. These studies suggest that the basic biochemical defect(s) in cystic fibrosis is not an absence or deficiency in enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrate side chains.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is the most common form of chronic pulmonary disease in the pediatric age group.  As these children survive longer with improved therapy, the incidence of pneumothorax has increased.  In our patients who were more than 10 years of age, the incidence of pneumothorax was 12.5 percent.  We have reviewed the records of 22 patients who have had 44 episodes of pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis.  In addition, our experience includes one child with histiocytosis in whom pneumothorax was a serious complication. One other pneumothorax occurred in a teen-age girl with apical bullous disease.  A child who presents with even a minimal pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis is at considerable risk of developing an increasing lung collapse.  Even if the pneumothorax resolves, there is a high risk of recurrence.  In children treated with only a chest tube there was a 50 percent recurrence. Consequently, we recommend a chest tube for any episode of pneumothorax in a child with cystic fibrosis, with installation of a sclerosing agent when the lung expands.  Three of our patients so treated had no recurrence.  Children who have a persistent air leak are confined to bed, retain secretions, and pursue a rapid downhill course.  A more aggressive approach to these children, consisting of thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, pteural symphysis, and pulmonary lavage is feasible and the mortality rate is low.  A pneumothorax in a child with no evidence of cystic fibrosis is a rare event.  A persistent air leak is an indication for thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, and lung biopsy.  Histiocytosis X is one rare cause for this complication in children.\\n',\n",

Seventeen cases of cystic fibrosis were diagnosed at Medical City Teaching College Hospital, University of Baghdad, between 1970 and 1976.  In this study the sex-ratio was 2:1.

Sweat-formation was induced by pilocarpine-iontophoresis or by local injection of carbamylcholine (Doryl). RLA-values between O (not measurable) and 460 ng/ml.h were measured. With increasing sweat flow-rate a tendency to lower RLA-values was detected. No significant difference was observed between CF and controls. From the observation that RLA of sweat is up to 30 times higher than that of plasma, it is concluded that RLA is probably released not from plasma but from the sweat glands themselves, where it is stored or synthesized.\\n',\n",

When the storage iron was within the normal range (+/2+) children with cystic fibrosis absorbed 10-38% (Xa+/-S.D.=21+/-9.3) of the oral 59Fe2+ dose which is identical with the 59Fe-absorption in normal children with normal iron stores (9-45:23+/-8.7%). Depleted iron stores caused an increase of 59Fe-absorption to 43-95% (Xa+/- S.D.=62+/-19) in children with cystic fibrosis and to 45-100% (Xa+/- S.D.=73+/-18) in control children. The interruption or continuation of pancreatin maintenance therapy and the simultaneous administration of 1-1.5 g pancreatin did not influence 59Fe2+ absorption in cystic fibrosis. There is no evidence for a pancreatic factor required for or inhibiting inorganic and food iron absorption in human beings. Iron absorption is controlled also in cystic fibrosis chiefly by the amounts of available storage iron. It is therefore not justified to apprehend the development of hemosiderosis in children with cystic fibrosis who are not or not sufficiently treated with pancreatin.\\n',\n",

Human rectal goblet and columnar cells transported 3H- glucosamine-labeled secretory products at a substantially slower rate than do comparable colonic cells in smaller mammals. Within any one biopsy sample, the movement of labeled mucus in goblet cells varied widely among cells. Even with individual cells, labeled mucous granules often did not move in concert toward the apical cell surface. Average transport time in the cells of six cystic fibrosis patients and six sibling controls did not differ significantly from those of four adult controls. The carbohydrate composition of glycoprotein secretions of rectal epithelial cells was investigated by comparing autoradiographs of 3H-glucosamine-labeled biopsies with those labeled with 3H-fucose, 3H-N-acetylmannosamine, and 35S- sulfate. The patterns of incorporation of these four precrusors into normal goblet and columnar cells suggested that both cell types may alter the quantity and composition of newly synthesized glycoproteins as they migrate, mature, and senesce. Incorporation patterns in cystic fibrosis biopsies were indistinguishable from those of sibling or adult controls. With the techniques used, no abnormalities of epithelial glycoprotein production were detected in cystic fibrosis rectal mucosa.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have studied seven patients with C.F. and ten normal children and have confirmed the low levels of E.F.A. both in plasma and in red-cell membrane in the C.F. group.  We would like to report here preliminary results on the fatty-acid pattern of the lecithin fraction of bronchial mucus in the same group of patients and controls.  Content of palmitic acid was lower and that of oleic acid was higher in the C.F. patients than in normal children.  This abnormality in the fatty-acid composition of the lecithin of the mucus could be an important finding in relation to the respiratory symptoms in C.F.  Some experimental work supports this hypothesis.\\n',\n",

The babies presented with signs suggestive of intestinal obstruction possibly due to meconium ileus, and glycerin suppositories were inserted to speed the passage of meconium so that the BM test could be done to help confirm the diagnosis.  The tests were positive but the babies were subsequently shown not to have cystic fibrosis, and we found that the glycerin suppositories themselves produce the typical blue colour on the test strip.\\n',\n",
       " 'I have found that cystic fibrosis (C.F.), which is very common in South West Africa, occurs almost exclusively in white Afrikaners, probably as a result of inbreeding, the drift from the Northern Cape Colony, and religious and geographical separation.  However, I have not found C.F. in the descendants of the Angola Boers, a small proportion (6 - 7%) of the White population who belong to a small branch of the Dutch Reformed Church.  The absence of C.F. may stem from their limited numbers (7000) but I suggest that it may have at least partially a genetic basis.  Homozygotes with C.F. are subject to salt-losing crises which can be fatal in hot weather and heterozygotes often have an increased concentration of sodium and chlorine ions in their sweat.  The influence of environmental temperature and drought may explain why C.F. occurs among Blacks in temperate zones of the United States but not in Africa, and is less frequent in the hot southern regions of Europe than in the colder, more northern areas.  Negative selection of this type may have operated only in hot, arid environments and the possibility that other environments offered advantages to C.F. heterozygotes cannot be excluded.\\n',\n",
       " 'Increased sodium concentration in sweat is a characteristic of cystic fibrosis.  However, we have read nothing on the sodium content of breast milk in this condition.  A patient with sweat-test-proved cystic fibrosis with mild pulmonary disease had her first baby by normal delivery at term.  Samples of breast milk were obtained on the sixth and seventh days post partum when the mother was not breast feeding.  The two sodium concentrations were 132 and 280 mmol/l, concentrations much higher than in any other milk sample tested at this hospital in a large survey and higher than any we have seen in the literature.  Milk of such high sodium content would be unsafe for a baby, and we suggest that, if mothers with cystic fibrosis were to breast feed, the sodium of the mild should be measured first.  The breast, like so many other exocrine glands, seems to be affected by the secretory abnormalities of cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'The percentage fatty-acid composition of the various plasma-lipid fractions from cystic-fibrosis patients with and without pancreatic insufficiency, obligate heterozygotes, and normal subjects was determined. Only the cystic-fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency had significantly abnormal fatty-acid composition. This general observation did not correlate with vitamin-E deficiency, age, sex, or severity of the disease. Thus the altered fatty-acid composition of the different plasma-lipid fractions appears to be a secondary consequence of the pancreatic insufficiency commonly associated with cystic fibrosis and not a direct metabolic defect related to the cystic-fibrosis gene itself.\\n',\n",
       " \"We found that the Szczepanski bromide test, which we simplified with the aid of ion-sensitive electrode, is suitable for the detection of C.F. heterozygosity in most cases.  We examined the sweat of 74 randomly selected children with respiratory asthma during the past 2 years, the sodium and chloride concentrations and bromide index being determined.  Sodium and chloride concentrations in the sweat of the asthma children were slightly but significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the controls.  The difference in bromide index was even more significant (P < 0.01).  This suggests that C.F. gene carriers are unusually prevalent among children with bronchial asthma.  One possibility is that enhanced ion loss in various diseases with allergic pathological mechanisms is secondary in nature.  However, this seems unlikely since in our material high sweat-electrolyte concentrations were observed in only a proportion of control children whose illness was similar in severity to that of the asthmatic children, and normal sweat values were obtained even when the child's condition was very serious.\\n\",\n",

The early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is extremely urgent, since the disease is treatable.  The standard test is the sweat test. Over 99 percent of patients with this disease will have elevation of sodium and chloride in the sweat.  Three tests are used to assess pancreatic function.  First is the measurement of stool trypsin and chymotrypsin.  Second, stimulation with hormones - the standard secretin and CCK tests.  A third procedure tests carbohydrate tolerance, an increasingly important test since an ever-growing number of patients in late childhood and early adulthood with cystic fibrosis are being found to have diabetes mellitus.  The commonest and most important hereditary disease that affects pancreatic function is cystic fibrosis.  The commonest form of pancreatic insufficiency in childhood is mucoviscidosis or cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  The incidence of this disease is approximately one per 1000 live births.  It occurs in all races, and the defect is transmitted as an autosomal recessive.  The classic features are frequent bowel movements with the characteristic appearance of steatorrheic stools, and a failure to grow and develop normally.\\n',\n",

Patients with CF present with a broad spectrum of symptoms which vary considerably in severity. This older age group represents approximately 10% of our current roster of patients with CF. This disease is no longer confined to early life and will continue to be seen with increasing frequency in older patients.

       " 'Using a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay, we have confirmed that serum from individuals with bronchial asthma and serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF cause ciliary dyskinesia, whereas normal healthy control sera do not.  To evaluate the specificity of the ciliary dyskinesia activity (CDA) detected, we bioassayed serum from eight patients with bronchial asthma.  We found that all eight asthmatic sera caused a ciliary dyskinesia reaction; however, sera from asthmatics generally caused a subsequent ciliostasis (cessation of ciliary beating).  Concurrent evaluation of all sera for CDA by bioassay and for cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) by electrofocusing showed that all CDA-positive sera except seven of the eight asthmatic sera were also positive for CFP (our specific marker for the CF gene).  These two finding indicated that the activity detected in patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases could be a substance different from a CF-specific CDF.  To test our hypothesis, we set out to purify the CDAs in asthmatic, CF homozygote and OHCF sera.  Representative results clearly indicate that the asthmatic CDA is found in DEAE-II and Sephadex G-200 Fraction II, whereas the CDA found in CF and OHCF sera elutes in DEAE-I and Sephadex G-200 Fractions III and IV (weak CDA).  We conclude that the CDAs in asthma and CF are distinct substances.  Our findings may facilitate purification of what we feel is a CF-specific CDF from CF and OHCF serum.  Purification is a prerequisite to elucidating the exact nature of this substance and its role in the pathophysiology of CF.\\n',\n",

       " 'Preliminary nitrogen balance trials have been carried out with six patients known to have pancreatic insufficiency to investigate the utilisation of protein from a general diet; protein from a general diet plus exogenous pancreatic extract; and pre-digested protein, comprising 85% of dietary nitrogen intake, in the absence of a pancreatic supplement.  In all cases, the addition of pancreatic supplement to the general diet improved protein digestibility and utilisation.  Substituting 85% of the dietary protein with the enzymic casein hydrolysate resulted in further improvement in nitrogen balance (but not digestibility) for five of the patients. Urinary nitrogen levels of the casein hydrolysate diet tended to be lower, which accounts for the finding above.  With the acid-hydrolysed protein, urinary nitrogen was higher when compared with the excretion from the partial casein hydrolysate and provided smaller positive nitrogen balances.  These preliminary findings indicate that, for some patients with pancreatic insufficiency, partial hydrolysates have greater potential for nitrogen retention than the administration of exogenous pancreatic extracts with intact protein.  It is suggested that a daily supplement of pre-digested protein might be advantageous for CH children to ensure that minimum protein requirements are met.\\n',\n",

       " 'We have developed a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay for use in investigating a possible correlation between cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF) in human serum. The bioassay requires high standards of tissue selection, and all epithelial tissue must be free of underlying connective tissue. When serum samples were collected and processed carefully and warmed to 37 degrees before assay, CDF could be reliably detected in 31 of 31 sera from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes in 35 min or less without prior fractionation or concentration of sera, whereas 13 of 14 normal control sera were nonreactive. CDF-positive serum reacts in three consecutive phases: (1) initial increase in ciliary beat frequency, (2) ciliary dyskinesia, and (3) tissue destruction with extrusion of single ciliated cells, mucus, and debris. Our results confirm the association of CDF with cystic fibrosis. The bioassay is not specific for CF, however, when whole sera are bioassayed, since serum from several patients with bronchial asthma also caused ciliary dyskinesia. However, this finding need not preclude using rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelial tissue as an assay for following the purification of CDF. Isoelectric focusing showed that the presence or absence of CFP corresponded with that of dyskinesia activity in all sera tested except for the active samples from seven asthma patients, which were negative for CFP. The results indicate that CFP and CDF may be identical or closely related markers for the CF gene, and suggest that the activity detected by the rabbit tracheal bioassay in sera from patients with asthma and other diseases probably is caused by a substance different from a CF- specific CDF.\\n',\n",

Thomas and coworkers communicated with us for the purpose of determining possible reasons for their inability to detect CFP by electrofocusing.  Key points made during these conversations are reiterated below in a firm attempt to alleviate future problems by inexperienced investigators in their attempts to use analytic electrofocusing to detect CFP.  In our communications with Thomas and coworkers we learned that, despite our suggestions, they had not analyzed the samples they screened by either using the equipment of Awdeh et al. or employing our standardized procedure.  It is unknown whether or not they exercised the requirements for serum sample collection, processing, and storage.

       " 'We have attempted to reproduce the isoelectric focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) method specified by Wilson et al. in our laboratory.  Since the resolution obtained with their procedure appeared to be inadequate for identifying single protein bands in the relevant region, we have incorporated several methodologic improvements into the isoelectric focusing technique.  These improvements have significantly enhanced the resolution and have thus enabled us to demonstrate a greater degree of heterogeneity of serum gamma-globulins than is visible in the paper of Wilson et al. Despite the significant increase in the number of bands resolved by our method, a difference among CF, heterozygote, and control sera in the pH 8.4 - 8.5 region could not be detected.  In addition, the two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis technique of Altland et al. has been tested in our laboratory.  We have also modified this analytic procedure, enabling the fractionation of several small proteins from a portion of the IgG fraction.  Again, despite an improvement in resolution which reveals more heterogeneity, no unique protein has been observed consistently in the CF and heterozygote area.\\n',\n",

The possibility that the effects of the two drugs may be additive was investigated by assessing their combined effects on glandular and salivary C++ and protein in the rat submaxillary gland. Individually, their effects were also assessed in relation to the dose used. Results indicate that: (1) treatment for 7 days with 0.05, 0.50, and 5.0 mg/kg daily dose of reserpine caused, respectively, a 45%, 95%, and 120% increase in glandular Ca++ and a 9.3%, 16.5%, and 37.4% increase in glandular protein; (2) treatment for 7 days with a 5.0 mg/kg daily dose of isoproterenol caused a 138% increase in gland Ca++ and a 12.38% increase in gland protein. Treatment with a 5.0 mg/rat daily dose of this drug caused increases of 166% and 10.3% in gland Ca++ and protein; (3) in experiments involving a combination of the two drugs, isoproterenol was administered in a 5.0 mg/kg daily dose from days 1-7 and reserpine in a 0.5 mg/kg daily dose from days 4-10 of the treatment schedule. This procedure resulted in (a) a 217% increase in gland Ca++ and a 25.7% increase in gland protein; (b) a marked accumulation of a granular, basophilic material in acinar cells and the development of intraductal precipitates; (c) the secretion of turbid saliva with high Ca++ and protein concentrations after a secretory dose of isoproterenol (this type of stimulation also reduced the gland Ca++ (50%) and protein (20%) contents and produced vacuolization in the acinar cells); (d) the secretion of saliva with elevated Ca++ and protein in response to pilocarpine (these elevated concentrations were, however, one-fifth of those obtained after isoproterenol stimulation); (e) the secretion of smaller volume of saliva after both types of stimulation. These findings indicate that both IPR and reserpine have a dose-related and significant effect on submaxillary gland Ca++ and protein and that their individual effects are synergistic. The implications of this synergism for the physiologic state of the submaxillary gland and for the secretory abnormality of cystic fibrosis are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'The key enzymes in the synthesis of the naturally occurring polyamines, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) decarboxylase, were investigated during cell growth and aging in fibroblast cultures from normal patients and patients with cystic fibrosis. A linear correlation between increased S-adenosyl methionine activity and putrescine concentration was apparent in all cell lines. A putrescine concentration of 0.8 mM was optimal for enhancement of SAM decarboxylase activity. The passage number of the cell line correlated inversely with maximal putrescine-stimulated SAM decarboxylase activity, earlier passage numbers having the highest specific activity (Fig. 1). No significant differences in basal or putrescine-stimulated SAM decarboxylase activity were noted between normal fibroblast cultures and cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (Fig. 2). SAM decarboxylase activity increased as the cell lines approached confluence. Activity was lowest during exponential growth (Fig. 3). ODC activity was increased during early exponential growth and fell as cells reached confluence (Fig. 4). No differences in ODC activity and putrescine inhibition between the normal and cystic fibrosis cell cultures at equivalent points of exponential growth were noted.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have developed an improved method for the detection of cystic fibrosis protein (CFP). The method employs the LKB Multiphor to electrofocus whole serum, instead of the apparatus used in previous studies. Two basic modifications were necessary: (1) a pH 2.5--10.0 gradient instead of a pH 5--10 gradient, and (2) constant power for focusing the serum proteins instead of constant voltage. The first modification ensured adequate dissolution of the CFP-IgG complexes (or other precursor complexes which may liberate CFP). The second modification ensured a linear gradient (between pH 3.8 and pH 9.2), excellent resolution in the pH 8--9 region, and the separation of CFP within 2 hr without overheating of the gel. Electrofocusing with the LKB Multiphor permits the detection of CFP in as many as 24 serum samples per gel. Results obtained from the analysis of 31 cystic fibrosis, 28 obligate heterozygote carrier, and 28 normal control sera indicate that CFP can be reproducibly and accurately detected in sera using the LKB Multiphor.\\n',\n",
       " 'Pulmonary clearance for Staphylococcus aureus has been examined in two inbred strains of mice with some hereditary alterations resembling cystic fibrosis (CF).  These mice were mice with abnormal electrolyte metabolism (DBA/@J-cri), mice with spontaneous pneumonitis (C57BL/6J-bg), and mice without any CF-like alterations (BALB/c).  The methods used to produce pulmonary infection were essentially those of Laurenzi and associates adapted as needed for mutant mice.  The animals mentioned above were exposed to a finely divided aerosol suspension of a coagulase-positive strain of S. aureus in phosphate buffer.  Immediately after the exposure, half of the animals were killed, and the remaining half were killed 4 hr later.  In each experimental unit the mice killed immediately after the exposure were as similar as possible to the mice killed 4 hr later with respect to genotype, age, and sex; some were siblings. The uncleared bacteria (UBR) in 4 hr were 0.20 for the mice without any CF-like alterations (BALB/c) and the C57BL/6J-bg, bg/bg genotypes; 0.28 for C57BL/6J-bg, +/? genotypes; 0.50 for the DBA/2J-cri, +/? genotypes; and 0.56 for cri/cri mice.  The number of viable staphylococci found immediately after the aerosol exposure (Co) in the C57BL/6J-bg strain is significantly lower than the Co of the BALB/c (P < 0.05) and DBA/2J-cri strain (P < 0.01).  The latter two did not differ from each other.  There was no sex difference with respect to the UBR and Co data.  The DBA/2J-cri strain of mice, where the cri mutation first appeared, has a decreased capacity for clearance of S. aureus by the lung.  Together with the other CF-like alterations of the cri mutation, namely failure for the reabsorption of Na+ by the parotid duct, high level of Na+ in the fur, and CF abnormal serum factor activity in the serum of the cri/cri mice, we suggest that the cribriform degeneration mouse mutant may provide a potential animal model for studying CF.  The finding of a mouse mutation with electrolyte alterations and CF-like abnormal serum activity, simialr to the activity found in CF children, in an inbred strain of mice with a decreased bacterial clearance by the lungs, makes these mice very useful for CF studies.\\n',\n",
       " 'This study utilized isoelectric focusing and electrophoresis in an attempt to detect a cystic fibrosis (CF) serum factor(s), for which there is considerable indirect evidence.  The method of isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) specified by Wilson et al. (53), as reproduced in our laboratory, did not enable the detection of a CF factor protein reported to focus near pH 8.4-8.5. Consequently, we employed our modified IEFAG techniques, which enabled us to demonstrate significantly enhanced resolution and striking heterogeneity in serum gamm-globulins.  Despite the significant increase in the number of bands resolved by our methods, neither a difference at pH 8.4-8.5 nor other differences throughout the alkaline pH range could be detected consistently in the CF and heterozygous sera.  The two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis technique outline by Altland et al. (2), as reproduced in our laboratory, indicated that at least one small, cationic protein could be fractioned from all serum samples.  Improvements in the method of disc electrophoresis resulted in the observation of numerous bands from some samples and of differences among the samples, but no protein band unique to the CF genotypes was observed.  Our approach, employing different electrophoresis techniques and varying the conditions of sample analysis, should have increased the likelihood of detecting a protein or proteins specific for the CF genotypes.  Despite the many variations in our approach, no consistently unique protein was observed in the CF or heterozygous sera.  A CF serum factor cannot be readily demonstrated by the electrophoretic techniques described.  The value of the \"biophysical assay\" and the \"nonbiologic technique\" reported in the literature is suspect, and the promise and applicability of these techniques as diagnostic tests for the CF gene should be carefully evaluated.\\n',\n",
       " 'The total activity and isoelectric focusing patterns of arginine esterase, cathepsin B1, and several lysosomal hydrolases were normal in liver from two patients with cystic fibrosis. No abnormalities were observed in values for pH optimum, Km, and Vmax for arginine esterase and cathepsin B1 in liver from cystic fibrosis patients compared to those values for liver from the control subject. Soybean trypsin inhibitor at concentrations up to 100 microgram/ml had no effect on liver arginine esterase or cathepsin B1.\\n',\n",
       " 'Purified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), derived from eight cystic fibrosis (CF) and five carrier subjects, has been shown to be responsible for the mucociliary disturbances noted in the rabbit tracheal bioassay. A small molecular substance of less than 10,000 but greater than 1,000 daltons (by Amicon filtration) was found associated with gamma-globulin fractions isolated from sera of these same cystic patients and their parents. Once separated by PM-10 ultrafiltration, this small substance was unable to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in eight of eight CF and five of five CF carrier individuals unless pooled purified human IgG was added. In addition, the IgG-rich fraction retained by PM-10 ultrafiltration was still able to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in the bioassay, an event noted in our earlier work with whole serum. The size of the small serum substance and its association with IgG closely corresponds to that described for the oyster test system, as well as to that produced by cultured cells derived from homozygotes and heteroxygotes for this genetic disorder. The persistence of the ability to promote mucociliary disturbances by the IgG-rich retentate PM-10 fractions may be indicative of the ineffective molecular separation by the Amicon ultransfiltration apparatus or may represent another CF-related, IgG-associated substance not influenced by ultrafiltration. Speculation The genetic disturbance of CF can be explained by the presence of a molecule(s) which has an affinity for IgG, which in turn gives rise to the various physiologic facets of this disorder. This molecule(s) is present in CF only because of a deficiency of an enzyme which normally controls its level by inactivation.\\n',\n",
       " \"The cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia activities (CDA) in sera from CF homozygotes, heterozygote carriers, and individuals with bronchial asthma have been partially purified. Concurrently, the CDA's in sera from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or bronchial asthma were shown to be different substances by ion- exchange or gel permeation chromatographic procedures. Sephadex G-200 chromatography indicated that the CF-CDA eluted with a protein fraction of molecular weight (MW) 68,000-150,000 and that the asthma CDA was found in a protein fraction of MV greater than 150,000. The two activities could also be separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Prior acidification of whole normal, CF homozygote, obligate heterozygote, or asthmatic sera to pH 3.7 using EDTA, followed by fractionation of Sephadex G-200 removed all the CDA's from fractions of highermolecular  weight and shifted the activities to a protein fraction of MW 1,100-13,700. This procedure afforded a 200-fold purification of the CDA's in sera from patients with asthma or CF. EDTA treatment, however, also generated a CDA in previously nonreactive normal sera. Subsequent fractionation of the various active G-200 fractions on Bio-Gel P10 allowed for the separation of three separate activities (Bio-Gel Fractions I, II-IV, and V). Fraction I was shown to represent the activity in sera from patients with asthma and was determined to be C3a (MW 9,000). Fraction I was also found in normal, CF, and carrier sera and therefore is not a specific CDA. Fraction II-IV is thought to represent a CF-specific CDA (MW 5,000) since it could not be demonstrated in either normal or asthmatic sera but was found in sera of obligate heterozygotes. Fraction III-IV also did not react with antisera to human C3a. Fraction V was generated from all serum types upon acidification of the serum with EDTA and is thought to be a nonspecific CDA. Bio-Gel P10 filtration of Sephadex G-200 fractions provided 823-fold and 650- fold purification of the asthmatic and CF CDA's, respectively. Concurrent analysis of column fractions for CDA's by bioassay and for CFP by electrofocusing showed CFP only in fractions that contained the CF-CDA. Combined analyses employing acid disc gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and EDTA treatment of active CF-immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Sephadex G-200 column fractions, followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography, provided evidence that CFP was associated with the CF-CDA. It is unknown as yet whether CFP itself is responsible for the CF-CDA activity.\\n\",\n",

Con A binding sites were localized as a continuous layer on the external side of the plasma membrane in fixed fibroblasts of the three genotypes. In living cells, Con A induces both lateral and vertical movements of binding sites as expressed by cap formation and internalization of the plasma membrane. Fibroblasts of the three genotypes responded similarly to Con A treatment and failed to show significant detectable differences.\\n',\n",
       " 'Simultaneous red blood cell (RBC) and plasma volume determinations were obtained in 16 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and moderately severe pulmonary involvement. Hypervolemia with an increase in both RBC and plasma volumes was observed. Changes in blood volume were marked when values were indexed by weight but less significant when indexed by height. Decreasing systemic arterial oxygen saturation was associated with a progressive increase in RBC mass, hematocrit value, and hemoglobin level and a decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. RBC and total blood volumes were highest in patients with cor pulmonale and congestive heart failure. However, the compensatory polycythemic response in patients with CF was inadequate when compared with the response to hypoxemia in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. The insufficient oxygen-carrying capacity may compromise tissue oxygen delivery and necessitate treatment.\\n',\n",

Seven cases of visibly fatty liver were identified.  The incidence of visibly fatty liver on the initial roentgenograms in newly diagnosed cases of cystic fibrosis was 4%.  The cause of fatty infiltration of the liver in cystic fibrosis is not clear; however, the basis is most likely a nutritional deficiency in protein.\\n',\n",
       " \"Amikacin, a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used to treat 22 acute exacerbations of chronic pulmonary infections in 18 patients with cystic fibrosis. Patients ranged from 5 to 32 years of age and had mucoid P. aeruginosa isolated from sputum. The amikacin dose was usually 7.5 mg/kg every eight hours but was increased to 10 mg/kg and/or carbenicillin was added in selected cases depending on clinical course. Although P. aeruginosa was not eliminated from our patients' sputum except in two cases, there was a good clinical response in 19 of 22 courses. Significant improvement in chest x-ray films, spirometry, or arterial oxygen tension was documented in 11 of 17 courses. One instance of serum creatinine level elevation could not be attributed to this antibiotic. Two patients showed minimal (15 dB) unilateral high-frequency hearing loss on serial audiograms. Activity against many gentamicin-resistant strains and high blood levels are among the attractive properties of amikacin. Amikacin is clinically effective in treating Pseudomonas-associated pulmonary infections complicating cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",
       " 'A noninvasive, radionuclide imaging technique for measuring the rate of mucus clearance in the trachea (RT), was used to study gravitational effects on mucus clearance in 13 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), average age 17 years; 7 normal, nonsmoking adults, average age 26 years; and a normal subject who was recovering from an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In the upright position, nine of the CF patients and the subject with URTI demonstrated abnormal tracheal mucus clearance which approached normal when they were placed in 25 degrees headdown position. The normal subjects and two of the CF patients showed no significant difference in the RT measured in the two positions. The results of the study indicate that the force of gravity can be a major influence on tracheal mucus clearance in CF and URTI subjects. This conclusion supports the use of postural drainage as an effective form of therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Jejunal biopsy specimens were obtained from children with cystic fibrosis (CF), celiac disease (CD), or congenital exocrine pancreatic hypoplasia (CEPH) and from control subjects.  Sections were examined histologically and homogenates were used for measurement of enterokinase and sucrase activities.  This work was undertaken because enterokinase is considered a brush border enzyme, the release of which into the intestinal lumen is influenced by pancreatic enzymes, and also because we have recently shown a small bowel mucosal dysfunction in patients with CF.  As expected, sucrase activity was reduce (p < .05) in children with CD as compared to the other three groups.  On the other hand, enterokinase activity in children with pancreatic insufficiency (CF and CEPH) was higher (p < .05) than that of control subjects.  The present study has shown that in patients with CF and CEPH, mucosal enterokinase activity was increased as compared to control subjects.  It seems that the pancreatic enzymes play a large role in the turnover of enzymes in the brush border membrane and that the observed increase of mucosal enterokinase activity is probably explained by a reduced degradation in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\\n',\n",
       " \"Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas is a recessively inherited disorder generally considered to result in chronic pulmonary or digestive symptoms.  Therefore, it may not be readily appreciated that this disease can also present with anemia, edema, and hypoproteinemia, especially in infants taking breast milk or soy-based formulas.  The following example involving monozygotic twins given cow's milk formula since birth will serve to illustrate this association.\\n\",\n",
       " 'A study of 35 patients with cystic fibrosis demonstrated that increasing severity of pulmonary involvement was associated with a mild but definite increase in erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3- DPG) and a decrease in hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. The predominant regulators of 2,3-DPG were blood pH, cardiac output, and systemic oxygen transport. No significant relationship was observed between erythrocyte 2,3-DPG content and arterial oxygen tension. Hypophosphatemia may have prevented a greater increase in erythrocyte 2,3-DPG content. The inadequate increase in 2,3-DPG and consequent insufficient change in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, coupled with an insufficient compensatory erythrocytic response, may adversely affect tissue oxygenation in patients with severe cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

In view of a report that intravenous administration of soybean oil emulsions normalized sweat sodium values in CF children, we studied the effects of orally administered essential fatty acids (as corn oil) for one year. Some improvement was noted in all patients, but no one consistent factor predominated. However, arachidonic acid, which was found only in trace amounts or was absent in sera of all children with CF before the clinical trial, was increased significantly in the sera after the oral administration of EFA for one year. Other findings included a significant decrease in sweat sodium and T3 in most patients.\\n',\n",

Personality testing of the parents showed that 32% of the fathers and 22% of the mothers obtained scores in the range suggestive of emotional disturbance. The Family-Concept O Sort assessment of family interaction indicated that the primary effect of having a child with cystic fibrosis was in terms of decreased family satisfaction and family adjustment. The results do not support previous estimates of an increased incidence of emotional disturbance in children with cystic fibrosis. Evidence for negative psychological impact of chronic illness on sibling development was also lacking. Future research would benefit from a focus on the strengths and resilience of children with cystic fibrosis and their families.\\n',\n",
       " 'Respiratory infections in infants and children cause much ill-health and also an appreciable mortality.  They are found at times in most school-children and in infants, especially those in large families and those living in poor circumstances.  In all respiratory infections the whole respiratory tract is involved.  For descriptive purposes it is useful to divide these infections into upper respiratory-tract infections, in which the infection is predominantly at the larynx or above; and lower respiratory-tract infections, in which the predominant infection is below the larynx. Acute upper respiratory-tract infections are usually viral and the poly-virus infection of coryza is the commonest.  Acute lower respiratory-tract infections are discussed in two groups: in infants under two years of age and in children over two (including cystic fibrosis).\\n',\n",

In the three cases presented it has been difficult to establish the true diagnosis.  In the first case, symptoms compatible with the diagnostic criteria of Beumont and his colleagues were directly the result of a slow-growing cerebral neoplasm which was elusive to diagnose.  The second patient, a boy with cystic fibrosis, showed symptoms strongly suggestive of anorexia nervosa and responded to dietary measures without pancreatic enzyme replacement.  We have been unable to demonstrate any organic disease in the third case and, hence, a presumptive diagnosis of anorexia nervosa has been made.  It remains to be said that this condition is extremely rare in boys and that anorexia with weight loss warrants extremely thorough investigation.\\n',\n",

       " 'We demonstrate previously that fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are significantly more resistant to the toxic effects of ouabain than normal human fibroblasts are. Ouabain is generally assumed to act primarily at the level of the cell membrane and to cause killing of cells by inhibiting ion transport. We have therefore examined the ability of normal and CF cells to survive exposure to ethacrynic acid, another inhibitor of ion transport, and to survive colchicine and aminopterin, resistance to which has been associated with membrane alterations in other cells. The effect of dexamethasone, which has a sterol nucleus similar to that of ouabain but is thought to have a different site of cellular action, was also tested. Exposure of the cells to ethacrynic acid, colchicine, or aminopterin did not reveal any differences in survival between normal and CF fibroblasts. However, CF cells survived exposure to dexamethasone significantly better than normal cells did. These results suggest that normal and CF cells do not differ in terms of a generalized resistance to ion transport inhibitors or to drugs that must pass through the membrane to be active. Instead, the results raise the possibility that CF cells have an enhanced resistance to drugs that have the sterol nucleus found in ouabain and dexamethasone.\\n',\n",
       " 'Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from several unrelated patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were tested for resistance to the cytotoxic effects of ouabain in comparison with cells from normal individuals. Cells from CF and normal individuals were plated at low density and exposed to ouabain at different concentrations for 24 hr. Dose- response curves showed that CF cells survived significantly better than did normal cells at all ouabain concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1 micronM in potassium-deficient medium. In medium containing the usual amount of potassium (6.25 mM), survival of the CF cells exposed to ouabain was decreased to that of the normal cells. If the glucose concentration of the potassium-deficient medium was decreased to 10% of the usual amount, the resistance of the CF cells to ouabain disappeared and their survival was identical to that of the normal cells. These findings may be useful in understanding the biochemical basis of CG and its clinical manifestations.\\n',\n",
       " \"Has too much attention been focused on antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis, thereby overshadowing other measures which have led to the improved prognosis?  This may well be true and there is no doubt that regular intensive physiotherapy, performed daily by the patients' relatives, plays the major part in improving airway obstruction.  More skilful nutritional management including adequate pancreatic replacement therapy and high-energy, high-protein diets will also have had beneficial effects on the respiratory defects. The infected CF patient may not require high doses of antibiotics; he too might benefit more from simple nutritional alterations.  It is not new to suggest that nutritional factors are important influences on the resistance to infection of the CF patient.  What we can now do is measure the different aspects of the immune response in such patients and those with malnutrition, so that the simplest and most direct therapy can be chosen.\\n\",\n",

       " 'The present study was initiated to determine the antibody response to lipoprotein of patients with various enterobacterial infections. This investigation was also considered important because patients with these infections respond differently to another antigen common to enterobacteriaceae, the common enterobacterial antigen. Included were 33 patients with cystic fibrosis, complicated by enterobacterial respiratory tract infection.  The lipoprotein (LP) antibody levels of healthy subjects and of patients with varied enterobacterial infections were determined.  None of the healthy children and only one of the healthy adults had antibodies against LP.  In contrast, 18% of the children with peritonitis complicating appendicitis, 24% of patients with enterobacterial infection of the respiratory tract complicating cystic fibrosis, and 42% of adult subjects with bacteremia complicating malignancy, had LP antibodies in the serum.  The reason for these striking differences in the immune response to this common antigen remains to be elucidated.\\n',\n",

       " 'The aim of the present study is to elucidate the correlation between etiology and histology in nasal polyps with special regard to cystic fibrosis (CF). Nasal polyps from 15 children with CF and a control group of non-CF polyps from 15 adult patients were examined by light- microscopy. The histological evaluation was carried out on a blind basis in order to avoid bias. Among the parameters used, the tissue eosinophilia proved to be the most valuable factor in the differentiation between CF and non-CF polyps, as only few eosinophils were found in the CF-polyps. The polyp glands were few and generally pathological. Some characteristics abnormalities in the grandular morphology are apparently more common in CF polyps. It is concluded, that the histological examination of nasal polyps is of importance for the correct classification of the patient, but the diagnosis of CF cannot be made based on microscopy of polyps. Further studies including blinded histological examination of nasal polypous tissue might contribute to a more differentiated diagnose of nasal polyposis.\\n',\n",

One important omission from the title and the abstract is any mention of safety.  Children with cystic fibrosis may develop heat prostration when exposed to high temperatures, which may cause massive sodium and chloride losses via the sweat.  This could occur with the method described.  The apparatus described by Gibson and Cooke in the classic pilocarpine iontophoresis method of collecting sweat is neither overly sophisticated nor expensive.

       " 'Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is a serious genetic disorder occurring mainly among the Whites and starting in early childhood or even at birth.  The name is a shortening of the old term Cystic Fibrosis (or Fibrocystic disease) of the pancreas.  This comes from the historical appearance at post-mortem first described by Landsteiner in 1905.  It was only in 1938 that Dorothee Anderson and Fanconi realised that the disease was a separate entity and not simply a manifestation of other illnesses.  Another name is Mucoviscidosis which gives a clue as to one of the most important features of the disease.  Mucus formed is thicker and stickier (more viscid) than normal and tends to clog up the bronchi and ducts, particularly the pancreatic ducts.  Chronic bronchitis with recurrent severe infection and malabsorption are the main symptoms of the disease. The other important abnormality is an increased amount of sodium chloride (salt) in the sweat.  This fact, used in the diagnosis, was first realised during a heat wave in New York in 1953 when it was noticed that most of the children with heat prostration suffered from C.F.  Little is known of the causes of the abnormalities of sweat and mucus.  Some generalised cell abnormality (? enzymatic) seems possible.  There is no doubt that the condition is genetically transmitted and most evidence favours a recessive mode of inheritance.\\n',\n",

In cystic fibrosis determination of serum isoamylase is of value, although absence of pancreatic serum isoamylase is a normal finding during the first year of life.  Demonstrable pancreatic serum isoamylase in such early life argues against the diagnosis.  After one year of age the test has a positive diagnostic value.\\n',\n",
       " 'A total of 133 patients with cystic fibrosis have been followed for up to 5 years with monthly examinations including bacteriological examinations of sputum. Sera from the patients were examined by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis for the occurence and number of precipitating antibody specificites against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Poor prognosis in cystic fibrosis was associated with chronic colonization (9 months - more than 5 years) of the respiratory tract with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and with an onset of the chronic colonization before puberty. Among the patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, poor prognosis was associated with high numbers of precipitins against antigens from these bacteria (up to 61). The number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa precipitins increased on an average with five per year in chronically colonized patients. Rapidly increasing number of precipitins was associated with poor prognosis. Patients with any degree of impairment of the ventilatory function and any changes on the chest radiographs could contract chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Poor ventilatory function and severe changes on the chest radiographs was associated with high numbers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa precipitins and with poor prognosis. Although many O groups of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found in the chronically colonized group of patients, 53% of the patients harboured strains belonging to O group 3 or 3/9, and the highest numbers of precipitins were found in serum from these patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'Abnormalities of Hageman factor dependent pathways have been described in a wide variety of human disease states. Congenital deficiencies of factor XII (Hageman trait) prekallikrein (Fletcher trait) and high molecular weight kininogen (Williams, Fitzgerald and Flaujeac traits) although resulting in profound in vitro changes, do not cause in vivo difficulties. In contrast, deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (hereditary angioedema) results in significant morbidity and mortality. Acquired diseases may exhibit decreased synthesis of these three proteins in cirrhosis and dengue fever. In vivo activation of factor XII initiated pathways occur in septic shock, disseminated or localized intravascular coagulation, typhoid fever, polycythemia vera, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, coronary artery disease, nephrotic syndrome, transfusion reactions, hemodialysis and extracorporeal bypass. Activation of both the intrinsic system and tissue mediators contribute to the vasomotor phenomena in carcinoid syndrome and postgastrectomy dumping. Roles for factor XII, prekallikrein and kininogen have been suggested in gouty arthritis, allergic disorders and cystic fibrosis but the evidence is not yet convincing in these disorders.\\n',\n",

Children with cystic fibrosis have moderately elevated plasma renin and secondarily elevated serum aldosterone value.  This is due to chronic sodium chloride loss through sweat.  Our patient had high serum aldosterone values associated with only slightly elevated serum cortisol value.  High  serum aldosterone value increased further despite correcting conditions which stimulate aldosterone secretion.  This suggests that long-standing salt depletion is not the only cause for abnormal renin-aldosterone system.\\n',\n",

The materials used in this study consisted of 266 consecutive autopsies from 1974-1976 and an additional 13 cases from previous years.  By far, the most common cause of N.D. in children was chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly vincristine, used for the treatment of malignant tumors.  Approximately 90% of these children developed N.D. and the changes ranged from mild to severe.  Approximately two-thirds of children with cystic fibrosis, congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure developed N.D. and the changes were mostly mild.  Only one-third of patients with congenital biliary atresia and malnutrition developed N.D. and the changes were always mild.  The frequency and severity of N.D. increased in patients who had prolonged clinical courses; no N.D. was seen in patients who died from acute cases such as trauma, acute infection, intoxication, acute renal failure or prematurity.  This type of N.D. may be considered as reactive to a wide variety of injurious factors such as drug toxicity, malnutrition, chronic hypoxia and chronic renal failure, either alone or in combination.  In contrast to previous reports of a low incidence of N.D. in children, there has been a sharp increase in recent years due to the advent of chemotherapy.\\n',\n",

However, the intrinsic advantages of X-ray microanalysis and the results obtained in this study suggest that this method, after further testing, may be a useful diagnostic acid for cystic fibrosis. In comparison with neutron activation analysis, X-ray microanalysis has the advantage of simultaneously giving the concentrations of several elements and may be accessible at any hospital with an electron microscope fitted with the necessary equipment. Nails of CF-patients are here shown to have increased concentrations of Na, K and Cl, which will make the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis more reliable.

The mean AIP-activities after THP-induction were 8.8, 12.7 and 34.6 for the three different genotypes respectively. There was no overlap between the values of CF-homozygotes on the one hand, and the values of CF-heterozygotes and normal controls on the other hand. All 24 specimens were correctly diagnosed in the present double blind study, indicating the very high degree of reliability of the THP- induction test in the detection of the predominant type of cystic fibrosis with fibroblast cultures. Normal controls and CF- heterozygotes could not be discriminated on an individual basis, but as a group the CF-heterozygotes displayed higher AIP-values.\\n',\n",

       " '12 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected with mucoid P. aeruginosa and presenting multiple precipitins in serum against this bacterium and 12 patients without P. aeruginosa infection were examined for occurrence of soluble immune complexes in their sputum sol phase by a complement consumption assay and a solid phase rheumatoid factor binding assay. The correlation between the results obtained in the two assays was significant (r = 0.625, p less than 0.01). The patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa showed a significantly (p less than 0.01) higher frequency of immune complex activity in their sputum sol phase, as compared to the patients without P. aeruginosa lung infection. These findings point to the possibility that chronic lung infection with mucoid P. aeruginosa in CF may be an immune complex disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Normal development of the pancreas is of great importance in the neonate and infant.  This review evaluates the development of exocrine pancreatic function, the hormonal control of this function, the interrelationship of pancreatic enzymes and pancreatic adaptation to food.  The functional changes that occur in different disease processes of the pancreas affecting the infant will also be discussed.  Since the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with orally administered pancreatic enzymes in children is often more difficult than expected, the practical approach to enzyme treatment will be discussed.  The morphological development and congenital malformations of the pancreas, tumors of the pancreas, the normal function of the exocrine pancreas, the development of the exocrine pancreatic function, developmental aspects of amylase activity and starch digestion, dietary adaptation of the exocrine pancreas, pancreatic function tests, pancreatic insufficiency, cystic fibrosis, Shwachman syndrome, isolated pancreatic enzyme deficiencies, the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatitis in childhood, and the treatment of acute pancreatitis are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Total body opacification is the phenomenon whereby introduction of iodinated contrast material into the blood stream renders structures differentially radiopaque according to their blood supply.  The term implies the physiology: it is the whole body which is opacified, in proportion to the iodine in its plasma and extravascular extracellular fluid at the time of the radiograph.  To the density inherent in the tissue before injection is added the opacity of the iodine circulating through and transuding into it.  Just as tissues, even those of \"water density,\" have minor intrinsic differences in x-ray absorption, so they may also have minor differences in blood flow and transudation into the extracellular fluid; the combination of these minor differences often makes the invisible visible.\\n',\n",

In 76% of the relatives of these patients increased sweat Cl levels were also found.  The authors give data of their clinical and allergy study and conclude that 13.7% of the patients under investigation had clinical characteristics of asthma, allergy and a functional exocrine disorder.  The exocrinopathy may be an important factor in the pathophysiology of certain types of asthma.\\n',\n",
       " 'Zinc status and the retinol transport system were examined in 18 retinol supplemented cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and 40 age-matched controls. Plasma vitamin A was significantly lower in the CF group as compared to the controls and correlated positively with plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) in both the CF and control groups. Plasma zinc of the CF group was not significantly lower than controls whereas hair zinc was. Plasma zinc was positively correlated with plasma RBP, vitamin A, and albumin in the CF group but not in the controls. Plasma concentrations of vitamin A, RBP, albumin, and zinc decreased with age in the CF group but not in the controls. The data support previous suggestions that low plasma vitamin A levels in CF are due to defects in the retinol transport system. The zinc status of the CF groups as a whole was judged to be low-normal however a subgroup of CF patients were in the marginal to deficient category. This subgroup also had lower levels of plasma vitamin A and RBP. The data suggest that zinc may be a contributing factor in the low plasma vitamin A/RBP levels of CF patients with marginal or deficient zinc status.\\n',\n",
       " 'A modified method of analysis of sweat chloride concentration with an ion-selective electrode is presented. The original method of sweat chloride analysis proposed by the Orion Research Corporation (Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139) is inadequate because it produces erratic and misleading results. The modified method was compared with the reference quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke. In the modified method, individual electrode pads are cut and placed in the electrodes rather than using the pads supplied by the company; pilocarpine nitrate (2,000 mg/l) is used in place of pilocarpine HCl (640 mg/l); sodium bicarbonate as the weak electrolyte is used instead of K2SO4. A 10-minute period for sweat accumulation is employed rather than a zero-time collection as in the original Orion method. The modification has been studied for reproducibility in individuals, reproducibility between right and left arm in individuals; it has been compared extensively with the quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke, both in normal individuals and in patients with cystic fibrosis. There is excellent agreement between the modified method and the quantitative reference method. There appears to be a slight bias toward higher concentrations of chloride from the right arm compared with the left arm, but this difference is not medically significant.\\n',\n",
       " \"The meconium plug syndrome (MPS) is a common cause of low intestinal obstruction in newborn infants. Usually, it is benign and not associated with other intestinal dysfunction. We describe the cases of three infants in whom there was intestinal obstruction consistent with the MPS and in which cystic fibrosis (CF) was later documented. We suggest that there is an association between the MPS and CF, and that the condition of all infants with the MPS be evaluated for the possibility of both Hirschsprung's disease and CF.\\n\",\n",

       " 'We have observed severe meconium plug syndrome (MPS) in a newborn infant who was found during the neonatal period to have extensive exocrine pancreatic deficiency.  Cystic fibrosis was excluded by several sweat chloride tests.  Our observation of MPS in a patient with exocrine pancreatic deficiency suggests that the MPS observed in the CF patients reported by Rosenstein is probably caused by pancreatic deficiency.  The frequent occurrence of meconium ileus (MI) in CF and the rarity of MPS in CF is curious, since they may be different manifestations of the same pathologic process. Conceivably, MPS may occur with total absence of pancreatic enzymes (as in our patient and in a few patients with CF).  Low levels of enzymes in CF may limit expression to meconium ileus.  We wish to suggest the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic function in these patients even if CF has been excluded by sweat tests. - There is conflicting, albeit fragmentary, data suggesting that exocrine pancreatic deficiency may not be the sole cause of meconium obstruction in CF.  Several investigators have suggested that MI may be the result of abnormal protein and mucoprotein secretions by the intestinal goblet cells and not from lack of pancreatic enzymes alone.  While these observations suggest that exocrine pancreatic deficiency may not play a major role in all instance of meconium obstruction, it is important to note that there may be little correlation between the histologic appearance of the pancreas and exocrine function.\\n',\n",

       " 'The combination of ticarcillin plus tobramycin (TT) or carbenicillin plus gentamicin (CG) was used to treat 82 patients with severe systemic gram-negative infection in a prospective, randomized study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the primary pathogen in 7 (93 per cent) of these patients. Patients treated with TT responded more frequently (92 per cent or 37 of 40) than patients treated with CG (71 per cent or 30 of 42) (p is less than 0.05). This difference was primarily due to a greater response to TT in patients with pulmonary infections (93 per cent versus 68 per cent) and infections due to Pseudomonas (92 per cent versus 70 per cent). Severity of underlying disease was also an important determinant of response. Except for a greater incidence of hepatotoxicity with CG (23 per cent versus 3 per cent; p is less than 0.02), there was no difference in toxicity, colonization with drug-resistant microorganisms or superinfection between the two treatment groups. The combination of TT appears to be superior to CG for the treatment of pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\\n',\n",

Massive abdominal distension secondary to a ruptured or unruptured volvulus has never been reported as a cause of obstructed labor.  The present report documents such a case, secondary to chemical peritonitis resulting from a ruptured midgut volvulus.  This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of presumed cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus and volvulus which led to ischemic infarction and perforation of the small bowel.  This case likewise emphasizes the need to consider the presence of other fetal anomalies, such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, when the usual maneuvers fail to relieve shoulder dystocia.\\n',\n",

       " 'Nine patients with cystic fibrosis but without digital clubbing (Group A) were matched, prospectively, by sex and approximate age to 9 cystic fibrosis patients with digital clubbing (Group B) and to 9 normal persons (control subjects). Patients in Group B had significantly (P less than 0.05) lower clinical scores and forced vital capacity than did those in Group A, indicating more severe pulmonary disease in the former; however, other spirometer tests of pulmonary function revealed no differences between Groups A and B. The degree of digital clubbing had significant (P less than 0.05) linear relationships to forced vital capacity (r = -0.73) and clinical scores (r = 0.853) for Groups A and B. Plasma concentrations of prostaglandins F2alpha and E were significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in both Group A (X +/- SE, 0.48 +/- 0.03 and 0.87 +/- 0.10 ng per ml, respectively) and Group B (X +/- SE, 0.68 +/- 0.04 and 1.81 +/- 0.16 ng per ml, respectively) compared to the control group (X +/- SE, 0.14 +/- 0.01 and 0.39 +/- 0.02 ng per ml, respectively). Group B had significantly larger concentrations than did Group A; however, plasma concentrations of prostaglandin 15-keto-13, 14- dihydro metabolite were not different in Groups A and B, and were significantly smaller than in the control group. These studies suggest that the degree of digital clubbing in cystic fibrosis is related to the severity of the pulmonary involvement and that the prostaglandin system may play an important role in this disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Massive hemoptysis (volume of expectorated blood > 300 ml in 24 hours) occurred in 38 (5 per cent) of 728 patients with cystic fibrosis.  Twenty-two of the patients were in the midst of a relatively long-lasting flare-up of pulmonary infection.  There was no other consistent precipitating event.  All but 7 of the patients were admitted after the initial episode and were treated with parenteral antimicrobial drugs.  Postural drainage was resumed as rapidly as possible after cessation of acute bleeding.  Vitamin K was administered to all patients.  Volumes of expectorated blood were as large as 2,500 ml with the initial episode.  Blood pressure changes occurred in 4 patients.  Five patients received blood transfusions.  Bleeding stopped without surgical intervention in all patients, usually within 4 days.  The 38 patients had a total of 85 episodes of bleeding.  No surgical treatment was undertaken at this center.  One patient underwent a lobectomoy at another hospital but continued to bleed postoperatively.  Ten patients died (mean survival after hemoptysis, 2.5 years; range, 3 months to 6 years). This survival rate is comparable to that of another group of patients with equally severe lung disease who had never bled profusely.  The other 28 patients remain alive from 7 months to 20 years after their initial episode.  Our dat suggest that massive hemoptysis complicating cystic fibrosis may not be as ominous an event as has been believed in the past.  Because of the tendency of most patients to stop bleeding without aggressive surgical intervention, future studies of new therapeutic measures for massive hemoptysis must have appropriate untreated control patients who receive only medical management.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mucus and serum are always present in sputum. The concentrations of their markers were measured in mucoid and purulent sputum from patients with chronic bronchitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis. Differences in the concentrations of both mucous and serum glycoproteins were greater among different macroscopic types of sputum than among diseases for the same macroscopic type. Comparison between diseases showed that sputum from patients with asthma had the widest variation in concentrations of markers of mucous glycoprotein and dry macromolecular weight. When the astham group was further analyzed, it became apparent that patients with extrinsic asthma without chronic bronchitis represented a homogeneous group, whereas those with intrinsic asthma, with or without chronic bronchitis, were responsible for the wide variation. The concentrations of markers of mucous and serum glycoproteins in a sputum sample were correlated with the apparent viscosity of the sputum to establish the relative contribution of the glycoproteins to the viscosity of sputum. In mucoid sputum, the mucous glycoprotein was most important in determining the viscosity, whereas when in infected sputum, both mucous and serum components contributed to the viscosity.\\n',\n",

       " 'To test whether the month of birth of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is seasonally distributed as reported in a Dutch survey, published Australian data were examined and no difference in the monthly variation was found between births of CF patients and their unaffected sibs. When the two groups were combined and analysed by periodic regression using successively higher Fourier terms, a significant fit to the observed frequencies was obtained with a bimodal curve. Possession of a single CF gene seems therefore sufficient for expression of the cyclic variation. In substantial agreement with the Dutch series, maximum frequencies were found to occur in March or April and in September. It is suggested that one or both parents may be subject to variable fertility mediated by a temperature-dependent mechanism. The relevance of a periodic fertility pattern in preserving the CF gene in the population by selective heterozygote advantage is discussed.\\n',\n",

Administration of cimetidine with pancreatic supplements reduced the faecal fat excretion in 4 out of 5 children, in 3 cases by more than 50%.  In Case 4 steatorrhea increased on cimetidine but without any symptoms and we have no explanation for it.  None of the children had any side effects from the drug. Further studies are needed to determine the indications of cimetidine in the dietary management of CF.\\n',\n",
       " \"We are in agreement with Schwarz et al. when they state that the sweat test has some limitations in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) and that the diagnosis is not justified on the basis of an abnormal sweat test unless there is other supporting evidence of the disease.  In our experience a much greater problem of sweat test accuracy occurs in hospitals where the test is carried out on a very much smaller number of patients and where the laboratory has a much lesser degree of experience than that of the authors.  We have had a significant number of patients referred to our regional children's hospital who have had abnormal sweat electrolyte measurements elsewhere, but unequivocally normal measurements when repeated by a laboratory carrying out a large number of tests.  We have not needed to go to the extent of serial collections of sweat and of giving spironolactone as have the authors.  If we obtain a test within the 'grey area' on repeated occasions, we carefully seek other evidence of the disease, particularly evidence of pancreatic disease. - We do not advocate the general use of spironolactone: the merit of this drug in our experiments on certain patients was merely to support our suspicion of temporary hyperaldosteronism, a condition which might have led to erroneous conclusions in the absence of K or Cl determinations.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Evidence is presented to support the concept that much of the allergy in cystic fibrosis (CF) is IgE mediated.  Total IgE levels were higher in allergic than in nonallergic CF patients.  Levels were also higher in those patients who had had the greatest number of chest infections in the preceding 12 months.  IgE antibody levels to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Timothy grass pollen, and Aspergillus fumigatus were higher in those with positive results from skin tests to these allergens.  The serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels of allergic and nonallergic CF patients did not differ but the overall mean values for IgG and iGM were higher than those reported for healthy British children.  The highest levels tended to be present in patients with the greatest number of recent major chest infections and the difference was significant for IgG.  16 patients had IgA levels >2 SD below the reported means for age-matched controls and 11 of these were nonallergic.  IgA levels were also higher in patients who had recently experienced major chest infections.  45 of the patients were tissue types for HLA A and B antigens but no significant clinical associations with single antigens were observed.  The antigen phenotype A1 + B8 was more common in patients with multiple allergic symptoms than in those with a single allergy or merely a positive result from a skin test. Nonsignificant increases of W19 in patients with frequent infections and of A2 in patients presenting with meconium ileus were also noted.  The data presented do not permit a choice to be made between the alternative concepts of allergy as a primary abnormality in CF, and allergy arising secondary to infection.\\n',\n",
       " \"The effects of an artificial diet on growth were examined in a controlled trial on 43 patients with cystic fibrosis. 28 patients received the diet for 12 months. Comparison was made between their growth before, during, and after dietary treatment. Growth changes were also assessed in 15 other patients who received a conventional diet. Artificial dietary treatment led to some improvement in height, weight, subscapular skinfold thickness, and a disproportionate advance of bone age for the group as a whole. Only 10 (36%) patients had a 'clinically' significant improvement in height, weight, or both- -i.e. more than 0.5 standard deviation score. Greatest improvements were in young and mildly affected patients. It is proposed that the future use of such an unpleasant and expensive diet should be restricted to a few selected cases, rather than given as routine treatment.\\n\",\n",

The children who were initially asymptomatic had normal lung mechanics in infancy but the 2 restudied later had abnormal radioisotopic lung function. The symptomatic children showed abnormalities in infancy and more marked changes later. It is concluded that the lungs in cystic fibrosis are probably normal initially and that damage occurs later even in the absence of symptoms.\\n',\n",
       " 'P-Amino-benzoic acid (PABA) is split specifically by pancreatic chymotrypsin from the synthetic tripeptide N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-PABA. The urinary excretion of absorbed PABA serves as an index for exocrine pancreatic function. The peptide (0.015 g/kg) was administered orally to 20 controls (aged between 5 months and 16 years), 6 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency caused by cystic fibrosis (CF), and 9 newborn infants. In the controls the mean 6-hour PABA recovery was 58.5% (+/- 11.2 SD). Recovery in patients with CF was lower (P less than 0.001) with no overlap. In newborn infants the mean 6-hour PABA recovery was 23.4 (+/- 17.7 SD); overlapping in 3 instances with the results in CF patients. This simple, noninvasive test thus appears promising and merits further investigation in younger infants, especially newborns.\\n',\n",
       " \"On a 'normal' diet increased faecal bile acid excretion was found in 14 of 16 children with cystic fibrosis who had steatorrhoea, but excretion was normal in 2 such children without steatorrhoea. The 16 children with steatorrhoea took 3 regimens of diet and therapy: a 'normal' diet with pancreatic enzyme supplements, a diet of reduced long-chain triglycerides with added medium-chain triglycerides, and the same diet with added pancreatic enzyme supplements. On each of these three regimens steatorrhoea and faecal bile acid loss were significantly less than on no treatment, with the lowest excretions occurring on the diet of reduced long-chain triglycerides with added medium-chain triglycerides and pancreatic enzyme supplements. Although a reduction in steatorrhoea was nearly always accompanied by a decrease in bile acid excretion, the initial bile acid loss was very variable and could not be predicted for any given degree of steatorrhoea. This suggests that at least one other factor, possibly liver disease or bile acid pool size, influences bile acid loss in the faeces.\\n\",\n",

Measurements on 2 babies with cystic fibrosis are also discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bray et al. conclude that the mass screening of newborn babies with chloride ion-selective electrodes is a feasible method for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis; they also suggest that this procedure might be used in conjunction with meconium analysis to reduce the incidence of false positive results.  In 1972 we reported the details of a child with proved cystic fibrosis in whom raised sweat sodium but normal sweat chloride levels were obtained during treatment with cloxacillin.  Attention was drawn to the implication of the finding with regard to screening procedures, and the suggestion was made that, in at least some children with cystic fibrosis, the cloxacillin radical might replace the chloride ion in the sweat.  When mass screening for cystic fibrosis is to be undertaken using methods based on the estimation of sweat chloride levels, it is therefore prudent to inquire whether the infant is receiving medication from any source and, if so, to interpret the results with caution. - These are instances of false-negative sweat chloride readings, but there is no evidence yet from our 1205 tests of any negative cystic fibrosis sweat chloride; the statistical chance of this is in any case small. These several cases suggest a need for a systematic investigation of the effect of medication on sweat ion levels in general as well as in cystic fibrosis cases.\\n',\n",

A control group of 42 young adults was similarly tested; control data for children were taken from previously published work. The prevalence of atopy (any positive prick test) in children with CF was 48%. Sensitivity to grass pollens and house dust mite was no more common in these children (29%) than in a normal population (34%). Hypersensitivity to Aspergillus fumigatus was found in 35% of children with CF and was associated with severe lung disease. The parents had a normal pattern and prevalence of atopy. Exercise- induced airways obstruction was present in only 22% of children with CF; its association with severe lung disease rendered interpretation difficult. The parents had a normal response to exercise. Both hypersensitivity to A. fumigatus and exercise-induced airways lability had the features of acquired characteristics.

The diagnosis of CF is usually made based upon the clinical presentation of chronic respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, a positive sweat electrolyte test and, often, a family history of the disorder.  The manifestations of chronic cough, recurrent pneumonias, bronchiectasis with clubbing, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and malabsorption secondary to pancreatic insufficiency are so well associated with cystic fibrosis that the diagnosis is usually not delayed.  However, it is often not appreciated by physicians that CF may be associated with a broad spectrum of less common manifestations as well as extreme variability in severity of illness.  Lack of familiarity with these manifestations may delay diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood. First, there seems to be mild clinical expression of the disorder in some patients (genetic variability).  Second, the subtle manifestations of CF are not widely appreciated by physicians in practice.\\n',\n",

It is possible that treatment may have modified the degree of weight loss noted after 12 months of age.

No difference in serum RNase activity was found among the groups of 17 normals, 21 CF patients, and 5 CF heterozygotes.

The activities of alpha-D-mannosidase, beta-glucuronidase and alkaline phosphatase were markedly decreased (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.002, p less than 0.001, respectively), while the activity of beta-D-fucosidase was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in meconium from the infants with CF. It is suggested that the decreased activity of alpha-D-mannosidase and beta- glucuronidase might contribute to the accumulation of the abnormal substances in CF meconium.

This paper will review current knowledge on the sources of meconium, and its composition in health and disease states.  The precise origin of the components of meconium has not been defined.  The qualitative and quantitative patterns of the individual constituents of meconium in health are considered: water and inorganic elements, enzymes, plasma proteins, glycoproteins, lipids, haemoglobin metabolites, steroids and bile acids, and sterols.  Meconium from infants with cystic fibrosis has been more extensively studied than in any other disease and the paper concentrates on this entity.  The composition of meconium in cystic fibrosis, screening tests for cystic fibrosis, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, and meconium ileus are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'A syndrome of dwarfism and retarded sexual development among Iranian and Egyptian teenage boys has been shown to be due to zinc deficiency.  A British patient with cystic fibrosis and nephrotic syndrome showed growth retardation and hypogonadism, associated with low plasma zinc concentrations.  The combination of cystic fibrosis and nephrotic syndrome appears to be fortuitous, and undoubtedly adverse effects on zinc homoeostasis were cumulative.  Nevertheless, zinc deficiency should be considered when somatic and sexual growth failure occur in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

This dilation may be generalised or confined to a single segment or lobe of the lung, and it may be tubular, fusiform (spindle shaped), or saccular (cystic).  The aetiology, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, complications, and prevention of bronchiectasis are considered. Cystic fibrosis affects many exocrine glands throughout the body. Presentation and diagnosis, treatment, complications and their treatment, management of associated social problems, and death due to cystic fibrosis are discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'The otherwise excellent article on bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis by Dr Margaret Hodson is seriously marred by the failure to emphasise that the advice on management and drug dosage is directed throughout to the adult and adolescent, and not to the child.  Firstly, tetracycline should not be prescribed for young children for obvious reasons; secondly, the dosage of all antibiotics recommended is high for infants and small children.  The final paragraph gives a pessimistic impression of an undoubtedly distressing condition by stressing the early mortality of the past and of many of the older patients of today, without noting the effect that early diagnosis - perhaps as a result of neonatal screening - together with more effective treatment may have in the future on the quality of life and length of life.\\n',\n",

       " 'Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from individuals with the autosomal recessive disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), were shown previously to be significantly  more resistant to the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone, than were normal human fibroblasts. Here cystic fibrosis fibroblasts are also shown to be more resistant than normal human fibroblasts to the cytotoxic effects of the sex hormones, 17 beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone and progesterone. Since cells are believed to contain different receptors for each of the steroid hormones, it is not probable than the resistance of CF cells to these hormones results from a receptor deficiency. This was shown by the fact that CF cells were found to exhibit the same receptor activity as normal cells for 3-H-dexamethasone. Furthermore, neither normal human nor CF fibroblasts could be demonstrated to contain detectable receptor activity for 3H-17 beta-estradiol. In addition, the studies of fibroblast killing by hormones led to the further interesting observation that normal human diploid fibroblasts, regardless of the sex of the tissue donor, are sensitive to killing by each of the sex hormones. These findings suggest that the cytotoxic effects of the steroid hormones may be observed independently of the specific hormone receptors. The studies reported here thus suggest that the resistance of CF cells to the different steroid hormones is probably the result of a defect in a pathway in cellular steroid hormone metabolism other than that involving receptors.\\n',\n",
       " 'The aim of this work was to make a preliminary examination of some hereditary diseases, related to precocious aging in order to determine whether the defects involved resulted from an impairment of the DNA repair capacity. To test for an impairment in DNA single strand capacity, in cells from patients with different diseases, we have followed the rate of the DNA after X-irradiation by sedimentation on alkaline sucrose gradients. It was found that all cells observed from Lesh Nyhan, cystic fibrosis, trisomy 15 et 21, retinoblastoma, were able to repair the single strand breaks in their DNA to the same extent and at the same initial rate.\\n',\n",
       " 'Pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary complications were studied in a group of 40 patients with cystic fibrosis who reached the age of 25 years. Mean values for vital capacity (VC), functional residual capacity, residual volume (RV), the ratio of RV over total lung capacity (RV/TLC), conductance, and the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second over VC were abnormal. There was a variable pattern of progression from patient to patient. The men differed from the women only in that they had a significantly larger TLC and inspiratory capacity than the women. The resultant preservation of VC may have an advantage for survival in those patients in whom it is observed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was encountered with increasing frequency with age. Massive hemoptysis did not result in early death. The occurrence of rightsided heart failure secondary to cor pulmonale, with or without respiratory failure, was a poor prognostic sign.\\n',\n",

Seventy-seven procedures were performed on 39 patients with cystic fibrosis.  Their vital capacities were improved in 46 of the 75 valid measurements. Arterial blood gas levels showed improvements in 14 of the 33 values obtained.  A prospective study is needed which incorporates the values of pre- and postoperative MMEV, RV/TLC, flow volume curves and arterial blood gas values.  An evaluation of the complications and ease of operation may be of greater value.\\n',\n",
       " \"This article presents our experience with bronchoscopy as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis.  The results from therapeutic bronchoscopy and bronchial irrigation in cystic fibrosis patients have been quite impressive.  Levels of blood gas after the procedure have generally shown improvement.  The vital capacity and FEF1 in general have shown small but consistent improvements.  The most dramatic effect has been the patient's own assessment of the operation.  These patients state that their breathing is less labored in that it is less rapid and much deeper.  Bronchoscopy offers an effective therapeutic tool in the management of pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, the benefit is short-lived and repeated bronchoscopic procedures are often necessary.  It must be accepted that there is a point in time when the cardiopulmonary state of a patient's cystic fibrosis may have progressed beyond salvageable limits.  It is our conviction that earlier bronchoscopy and thorough bronchial irrigation may prevent the critical pulmonary event which is followed inevitably by progressive deterioration of the pulmonary status of patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",

Cystic fibrosis should never be diagnosed solely on the results of any kind of sweat test; the diagnosis must be consistent with the results of the physical examination, history, and other studies, including a repeat of the two sweat tests at another time.  Only by clinical examination and repeated sweat tests can a physician confirm or rule out this diagnosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Properties of carboxypeptidase A of cultured skin fibroblasts from control and cystic fibrosis patients were studied using alpha-N- carbobenzoxy-L-glutamyl-L-tyrosine as substrate. Carboxypeptidase A was inhibited by thiomersal, cyanide, iodoacetate and N- ethylmaleimide in a similar manner for control and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts. Both trypsin and dithiothreitol treatment activated the enzyme, but 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited only in the presence of dithiothreitol. Both Zn2+ and Co2+ reversed this inhibition. Trypsin treatment of carboxypeptidase A produced a form of the enzyme having a higher KM value for both control and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts. Dithiothreitol treatment of control fibroblasts resulted in a form with similar properties to the trypsin activated form, but cystic fibrosis fibroblasts yielded a variant form with even higher KM and Vmax values. Since other properties were similar, it seems likely that this difference reflected binding of a molecule to the enzyme rather than of a defect in the enzyme.\\n',\n",

Cystic fibrosis patients excreted 3.22 +/- 1.16 nmol adenosine 3':5' (cyclic)monophosphate/g creatinine per 24 h vs. 1.97 +/- 0.43 for normal men (p less than 0.02); and cystic fibrosis patients excreted 0.50 +/- 0.16 nmol guanosine 3':k' (cyclic)monophosphate/g creatinine per 24 h vs. 0.30 +/- 0.07 for normal men (p less than 0.05). Subjects were all adults who had completed linear growth and sexual development, thus eliminating any possible effects of slower maturation of cystic fibrosis patients, and all subjects were male, thus avoiding the fluctuation of urinary cyclic nucleotides with the menstrual cycle, problems which had complicated interpretation of previous studies.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent substantially lethal inherited disease in the United States. Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis has been suggested because early diagnosis permits genetic counselling of parents and improved treatment and prognosis for cystic fibrosis patients. The fact that cystic fibrosis newborns have abnormally high meconium albumin seems to offer the best screening approach. Because we have had equivocal and false positive results with meconium albumin test strips, we have developed a nephelometric automated immunoprecipitation method for the quantitative and specific analysis of meconium albumin. On a total of 3895 meconiums so far examined, eleven albumin elevations of undetermined origin have been detected. Nine of these were associated with prematurity. There have been, so far, no detected true positives and no known false negatives. The normal range for meconium albumin is in agreement with previously published ranges determined using manual immunochemical methods. This method is rapid and economic. The question of sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of this and other detection methods is discussed.\\n',\n",

Population doubling time as estimated from cell count, protein and DNA was no different in the two groups. KM, Vmax, maximal uptake and time of half maximal uptake of AIB were no different in the two groups. Intracellular Ca pool size based on exchange of 45Ca with unlabelled Ca was significantly greater in monolayers from CF subjects.\\n',\n",

The levels of pancreatic type amylase were lower in the CF patients (median 26.5 I.U./1) than the controls (median 81.5) (P less than 0.001). The results for salivary-type enzyme, however, did not support the previously reported finding of higher than usual levels in CF patients. This discrepancy is probably due to differences in analytical methods. It is felt that this procedure will be of value in the investigation of patients for cystic fibrosis and other pancreatic disorders.\\n',\n",
       " 'The specific activity of several lysosomal hydrolases in normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) livers has been investigated. Neuraminidase activity with respect to two natural substrates (fetuin and bovine submaxillary mucin) is normal in CF livers. No significant differences were found between CF and normal livers in 4- methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-mannosidase specific activities determined at three different pH values (4.3, 5.65 and 6.5) corresponding to lysosomal, golgi and cytosolic components of the enzyme, respectively. The specific activities of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D- mannosidase and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase were also both similar in CF and normal livers.\\n',\n",
       " 'The activity of sialytransferase with regard to the glycoprotein substrates asialofetuin and asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin was determined in normal, pathological control, and cystic fibrosis liver homogenates. Cystic fibrosis and pathological livers have about 40% of the average normal specific activity for sialytransferase. Several properties of cystic fibrosis sialytransferase were investigated and compared to those of the normal liver enzyme (Alhadeff et al. 1977). The pH optima curves were similar, but cystic fibrosis sialyltransferase appears to be more thermolabile than the normal liver enzyme. Isoelectric focusing studies revealed that the three most basic forms of sialyltransferase which are found in normal livers are deficient or absent in most cystic fibrosis liver. The data suggest that altered glycoprotein-sialyltransferases may be present in cystic fibrosis livers, probably a secondary effect due to general liver pathology.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis in the northern sector of the French \"departement\" of Finistere is 1:1787 live births. Within this sector a concentration of the disease was found in a small area. The minimal frequency in this area, from 1946 to 1972, was calculated as 1 per 377 live births, the gene frequency being 0.0515. Genealogic analysis, going back to the beginning of the 18th century, showed a relationship between 8 of the 10 families to which the patients belonged. The origin of the deleterious genes may be explained by a least five primary ancestral couples living in the 18th century. Random drift is the most probable explanation for the concentration of cystic fibrosis in this region.\\n',\n",
       " 'This article is a review of the major research of the last 20 years on abnormal glycoproteins and abnormal glycoprotein metabolism in cystic fibrosis.  Its purpose is to focus attention on an area considered by the author to be of great importance for elucidating the primary biochemical defect in CF.  The majority of the studies on glycoproteins in CF have been done on crude mixtures of glycoproteins from tissues or tissue fluids, secretions or excretions.  Very few studies have compared the properties and composition of purified glycoproteins from CF patients and controls.  Comparative studies on the enzymes involved in the degradation and biosynthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins in CF patients and normal controls are discussed.  Several studies have suggested abnormalities in CF alpha-L-fucosidase and CF L-fucose metabolism.  There are several studies which indirectly suggest that abnormalities in glycoproteins or their metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.  Fruitful areas for future investigation are comparison of the properties and composition of specific glycoproteins purified to homogeneity from CF and control tissues, particularly with regard to carbohydrate composition; comparison of the activities and properties of the enzymes involved in both the degradation and biosynthesis of glycoproteins in CF and control tissues; and studies of the effects of increased electrolyte concentration on the physical-chemical properties of glycoproteins.\\n',\n",
       " \"alpha-L-Fucosidase (E.C.3.2.4.51) from two cystic fibrosis livers has been purified and characterized. Purification was accomplished by an affinity chromatographic procedure previously used for normal liver alpha-L-fucosidase. Characterization of the two cystic fibrosis alpha- L-fucosidases indicated that they were very similar to normal liver alpha-L-fucosidase with regard to pH optima profiles, Michaelis constants (Km's), subunit structure and antigenicity. However, gas liquid chromatographic analysis revealed altered carbohydrate compositions for both the cystic fibrosis alpha-L-fucosidases. The three major sugars found in normal purified liver alpha-L-fucosidase (mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid) were reduced in the cystic fibrosis alpha-L-fucosidases, on average, to 51%, 44% and 32%, respectively, of their normal amounts.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The cystic fibrosis (CF) culture phenotype of dermal fibroblasts (metachromasia, metabolic cooperation) of a group of 131 Danish CF patients and their families were studied to determine the distribution of the two CF culture classes and their prognostic significance. Of these, 62.6% (82) were Class I, 31.3% (41) Class II and 61.1% (8) were proposed to be genetic compounds. The occurrence of Class II was twice that found in a group of patients from New York (13%) and Minnesota (18%). The prognosis for Class II CF patients was considered to be poorer as: (1) The initial diagnosis was made earlier in Class II than in Class I or the compounds (63% of Class II were diagnosed in the first year of life, as compared to 35% in Class I and 13% of the compounds). (2) Only 5% of the Class II patients survived over the age of 15 years, both being deceased at the end of the study in 1976, whereas 24% of Class I and 63% of the compounds were over 15 years at the end of the study. This research added further evidence for genetic heterogeneity within the clinical syndrome, cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

The severity of kyphosis did not appear greater in the older age groups. Patients with retarded bone age may be more likely to have a significant spinal deformity. The presence of spine deformity does not correlate with the severity of pulmonary involvement, height, weight, serum protein and albumin in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'The large number and wide variety of precipitins detected in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients suggest that the precipitins may be nonprotective and even harmful to the patients.  These sputum precipitins were directed principally against food, fungi, bacteria, and human body tissue.  On the other hand, precipitins to Staphylococcus alpha-hemolysin was the main type of immunoprecipitin detected in CF serum and was found in 60% of the serum specimens examined.  It seems likely that the precipitins in patients with CF may be involved in the formation of immune complexes which, in conjunction with complement, may be responsible for the respiratory and gastrointestinal lesions that are common in patients with CF. The immune complexes may be the result of excess food and bacterial antigens escaping across the gut and lungs as a result of some abnormality of the SIgA system.  Over 80% of the sputum specimens tested gave positive precipitins in agar gel against human seminal fluid and colostrum, suggesting that some of the antibodies formed in CF patients could be directed against host tissue, and may account for an autoimmune-type reaction in CF.  Crossreaction between the high-titer antibody to Staphylococcus and basement membrane of lungs and pancreas, with complement activation, may occur in CF and required further study.  The high number of B-cells, as detected by antibody, coated complement, activated sheep erythrocytes, and EAC rosettes, may be partly responsible for the synthesis of the variety of antibodies detected in CF patients.\\n',\n",

       " 'Protease activity, assayed using 4- methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate, an active site titrant of certain proteases, is significantly deficient in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. The deficiency can be demonstrated with both chloroform-ellagic acid activated plasma in which the proteases can hydrolyze esters of arginine and unactivated plasma in which the proteases have negligible activity towards these esters. The deficiency can also be demonstrated by separation of the proteases by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels or by chromatography on agarose columsn. Since protease deficiency can be demonstrated with unactivated plasma, the deficiency in cystic fibrosis is probably due to a reduced number of protease molecules rather than their decreased catalytic efficiency.\\n',\n",

       " '46 sweat-samples from 32 children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (C.F.) and 35 samples from 23 control-children were collected with glass micro-capillaries. Protein was determined by ultramicro-electrophoresis. Results: 1. Protein was detected in 48% of the samples (C.F. and controls). 2. At pH 2.3, C.F.-sweat showed at least one more band than control-sweat. 3. At pH 8.9, C.F.-sweat occasionally showed one more band than the control-group. 4. At pH 2.3, more protein was found at the electrophoresis start point using C.F.-sweat, whereas at pH 8.9 the opposite was found. 5. At pH 2.3, protein was found in fewer samples than at pH 8.9. The \"C.F.-factor\" is postulated to represent a basic polyelectrolyte which induces the following pathogenic mechanisms: a) Aggregation of proteins giving rise to a high viscosity of secretions, such as saliva. b) Binding to the cell-membrane of the glandular epithelium, thus inducing a disturbance of active NaCl-reabsorption (e.g. by reduction of luminal passive Na+-influx).\\n',\n",
       " \"Complement components C3, C4, and C3A were estimated in 30 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 1 to 21 years (M:F = 16:14) and were compared with results in 40 healthy, age-matched subjects. The influences of the clinical score, sputum microbiology, and the patients' sex were also investigated. In contrast to most previous communications, this paper shows that, compared to the control group, a significant decrease of C3 (P less than 0.001) and C4 (P less than 0.02) was observed whereas C3A levels were not altered. There were no increases in complement. Shwachman-scores above or below 70 did not influence the complement levels, nor did exacerbations of the disease change the levels. No influence of the patients' sex could be shown. Pseudomonas aer. in the sputum was clearly associated with complement defects (14/18). Alternative-pathway involvement of complement activation could be demonstrated in 32%. The results make complement activation due to pulmonary infection most likely. The defects observed probably represent secondary changes.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The inborn errors of matabolism are a series of individually rare biochemical anomalies some of which cause serious clinical manifestations.  They are of great interest to biochemists and geneticists, as well as to paediatricians and internist for whom they often present special diagnostic and therapeutic problems.  The study of the inborn errors of metabolism also has implications in the fields of epidemiology and social medicine.  The number of known inborn errors of metabolism has increased rapidly in recent years, and others, as yet unidentified, presumably await recognition.  Only a few of these conditions can be treated now, but the realisation that early diagnosis is essential in order to achieve good results has stimulated interest in the possibility of examining either whole populations or selected predisposed groups of individuals for biochemical differences which characterise particular inherited metabolic diseases.  This article reviews some recent developments with particular reference to the indications for such screening programmes and progress in the identification of previously unknown inborn errors of metabolism in otherwise homogeneous population groups.  The inborn errors of metabolism are due to single gene mutations.  Recognition of the asymptomatic individuals who are heterozygous for the abnormal gene causing the disease may be important clinically and the identification has to be considered as one aspect of metabolic screening for the inborn errors of metabolism.\\n',\n",
       " 'Histological changes observed in the large intestinal mucosa of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, including crypt enlargement as well as intracellular and extracellular accumulation of mucus, have been considered by some to be useful diagnostic signs of this disease. The extent of these changes, however, has not been evaluated quantitatively. In this study, quantitative stereological methods were applied to biopsies of rectal mucosa from 5 CF patients, 5 sibling controls, and 2 normal adults, to measure goblet cell numbers, crypt luminal volume, and volume of intracellular mucus. It was found that CF crypt lumina were variably dilated, but that the average relative volume of intracellular mucus and the numbers of goblet cells in CF mucosae were comparable to those of sibling and adult controls. In CF biopsies, however, surface columnar absorptive cells consistently contained putative lipid droplets and rapidly accumulated additional large lipid droplets during short term organ culture. Lipid droplets were not observed in the same cell types of control biopsies before or after short term organ culture.\\n',\n",
       " \"A method for estimating a 'heparin binding capacity' of human serum is described. When human serum is diluted with a low ionic strength, heparin-containing buffer at pH 5.5, protein-heparin electrostatic complexes form in solution with subsequent formation of insoluble aggregates which can be collected by centrifugation. Quantitative determination of the relative amounts by weight of protein and heparin in the insoluble heparin-protein aggregates permits estimation of a combining ratio at which serum proteins bind with heparin to precipitate from solution. This weight combining ratio of protein and heparin is a quantitative measure of the total affinity for heparin of all proteins in serum which bind heparin at pH 5.57 to form an insoluble complex. An unusually high affinity for heparin by an abnormal serum protein or an increase in amount of a normally- occuring, high heparin-affinity, serum protein would alter the average protein: heparin combining ratio and increase the 'heparin- binding capacity' of human serum. The converse would be true for serum proteins having a low affinity for heparin, lowering the 'heparin-binding capacity' of human serum. The described method was used to evaluate the 'heparin-binding capacity' of serum proteins in normal individuals and in persons with cystic fibrosis.\\n\",\n",

For technical complexity, however, the method cannot be used for mass screening, but it can be useful for confirming the diagnosis in suspected cases. Relationships between serum factor inhibiting the effect of PHA on beta-glucuronidase, ciliary dyskinesia factor and carboxypeptidase B- like activity are discussed.\\n',\n",

At age 12 a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption due to fibrocystic disease of the pancreas was established.

       " 'Cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic trait of Caucasians, causes much of the chronic progressive lung disease in children and young adults.  It is also responsible for intestinal obstruction at birth (meconium ileus), pancreatic insufficiency with maldigestion and failure to grow, and obstructive liver disease in this age group. Furthermore, obliteration of the vas deferens causes aspermia and infertility in most males with CF.  Individuals with CF secrete sweat which contains excessive amounts of chloride and sodium.  Diagnostic criteria include detection of elevated chloride levels in sweat of individuals with typical pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or genital manifestations of the disease.  There are several, well documented alterations in the mucous secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis, any of which alone or in combination, may interfere with mucous clearance from the lung or from passageways of other organs. It seems clear that additional studies to define basic aspects of normal mucous biochemistry, physiology and pharmacology must precede or parallel studies of CF mucous secretions if data pertinent to CF pathophysiology are to be generated.  Particular needs include an understanding of the chemical determinants of physical and rheological properties of these secretions, and elucidation of mechanisms for control of sulfated glycoprotein biosynthesis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lipids from the sputum of patients with asthma and with cystic fibrosis were isolated and characterized. In both cases, lipids constituted approximately 30% of the dry material. Phosphatidlycholine was the most abundant lipid, Significant amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were present. Hexosyl ceramides, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine were present as minor lipid components. Apperciable quantities of neutral lipids were present, of which triglycerides and cholesterol were the main constituents. Phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylgycerol were highly saturated. Large amounts of phosphatidylcholine containing mostly palmitic acid, particularly in the asthmatic sputum, suggest htat this highly saturated. Large amounts of phosphatidylcholine containing mostly palmitic acid, particularly in the asthmatic sputum, suggests that this highly saturated phospholipid is synthesized in the upper airways for reasons other than its beneficial surface-active properties in the alveoli.\\n',\n",
       " \"To assess the value of detecting albumin in meconium as a screening procedure for cystic fibrosis [CF] 68,000 meconium samples were examined by BM Meconium Test, single radial immunodiffusion and benzidine reaction. The specificity and sensitivity of this combination of tests were 99.67% and 78.57% respectively. The prevalence of CF at birth was confirmed as 1:3600 in this country. This low prevalence resulted in a relatively high number of false positives. Therefore, a positive test result has a low predictive value [3.39%] and this is a serious drawback of the method. The experiences and opinions of 37 local paediatricians about the screening programme were evaluated by a simple questionnaire. Gold's decision rule was applied. The least relative cost of misclassification justifying a mass-screening programme was 3 times higher than the actual relative cost as suggested by the aggregate opinion of paediatricians in the region. These results support the view that with the methods used screening may have more disadvantages than not screening.\\n\",\n",

       " 'The purpose of this communication is to review our experiences with children with cystic fibrosis seen from January 1964 to January 1975 and to analyse the factors which have contributed to the improved prognosis which has occurred in this period.  The numbers of new patients have increased from six in 1964 to 12 in 1974.  Both sexes have been equally affected.  Respiratory infections, failure to thrive and diarrhoea were the predominant presenting features in that order, and thus any one of these presenting features should indicate that cystic fibrosis should at least be considered and excluded. Each patient was assessed monthly at the clinic during which attendance formal physiotherapy was carried out and the parents were instructed in the techniques of percussion and drainage.  Forty-two of our sixty-four patients are still alive and thirty-three of those fall into the excellent category, seven into the good and one each into the fair and poor.  During the period of this review there has been an obvious improvement with a fall in morbidity and mortality and with the increasing proportion of patients now in the \"excellent\" group.  We attribute these facts to earlier diagnosis, regular and careful follow-up and a supervised therapeutic programme including parent education and participation.  It would seem, therefore, that early diagnosis and active treatment prolong life and give better health.\\n',\n",

Cystic fibrosis is frequent among the Ashkenazic and Arab populations with an incidence approximating that for Caucasians of European ancestry (1:1,800 to 1:4,000 live births). It is about half as frequent in the Sephardim, rare in the Iraqi or Yemenite Jews and perhaps absent in Iranian Jews. The clinical picture of cystic fibrosis in Israel in all the ethnic groups was found to be the same as elsewhere in the world.

The markedly elevated frequency of CF in a considerable proportion of the human race presents a genetic enigma for which several solutions have been proposed.  Genetic heterogeneity, heterozygote advantage, reduced penetrance, genetic drift, and linkage or epistasis are discussed. The basic defect in CF and its fundamental biochemical and physiological ramifications are unknown.\\n',\n",

The observations led to the development of a technique for the isolation of mucoid variants in vitro based on enhanced resistance to carbenicillin.  Mucoid variants were isolated from various strains of Ps. aeruginosa and the exopolysaccharide found to be similar to that obtained from mucoid Ps. aeruginosa isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

The analysis yields a continuous distribution of V as a function of V/V0 represented as fractional ventilations of 50 compartments plus dead space. The procedure was verified by recovering known distributions from data to which noise had been added. Using an apparatus to control the subject's tidal volume and FRC, mixed expired N2 data gave the following results: a) the distributions of young, normal subjects were narrow and unimodal with a mean ln standard deviation of 0.56 plus or minus 0.13; b) those of subjects over age 40 were broader (ln SD 0.86 plus or minus 0.19) with more poorly ventilated units; c) patients with pulmonary disease of all descriptions showed enlarged dead space; d) patients with cystic fibrosis showed multimodal distributions with the bulk of the ventilation going to overventilated units; and e) patients with obstructive lung diseases fell into several classes, three of which are illustrated. These results suggest that our approach is well suited for clinical investigation.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Changes in the nitrogen concentration seen during the single-breath nitrogen washout reflect changes in relative flow (V) from units with differing ventilation/volume ratios (V/V0). The multiple-breath washout provides sufficient data for the V for units with varying V/V0 to be plotted as a function of the volume expired. Flow from the dead space may also be determined. In young normals the emptying patterns are narrow and unimodal throughout the alveolar plateau with little or no flow from the dead space at the end of the breath. Older normals show more flow from the dead space, particularly toward the end of the breath, and some show a high V/V0 mode early in the breath. Patients with obstructive lung disease have a high flow from the dead space which is present throughout the breath. A well ventilated mode at the end of the breath is seen in some obstructed subjects. Patients with cystic fibrosis showed a poorly ventilated mode appearing at the end of the breath as well as a very high dead space.\\n',\n",

Fifty specimens (83%) from 11 patients yielded Staph. aureus by one or more methods. Direct plating of purulent portions of sputum on to media designed for general use in respiratory infections gave unsatisfactory results (35% yield of Staph. aureus). Some increase in isolations was obtained with preliminary liquefaction of sputum; but the best results were given by the addition of a medium selective for staphylococci (mannitol salt agar, BBL) or by initial sonication of sputum (each 83% yield).

       " \"Sera from 33 patients with cystic fibrosis and two pediatric patients being treated for chronic pulmonary infections not related to cystic fibrosis and six sera or serum pools from uninfected individuals were tested with a microtiter radioimmunoassay for reactivity against exotoxin A and two proteases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Exotoxin A was purified from a low-protease strain of P. aeruginosa and shown to have adenosine diphosphate-ribose transferase activity and mouse lethality. Proteases were purified from an isolate of P. aeruginosa from a patient with cystic fibrosis and had proteolytic activity against elastin and collagen in an assay employing dimethylated protein substrates. The antibody responses of the patients detected using 125I-labeled antibody to human immunoglobulin were correlated with clinical evaluations expressed as a composite score based on pulmonary findings, case histories, growth and nutrition, and chest X rays. Values in the radioimmunoassay for patients' sera were compared with those of a control serum pool and expressed as the ratio of counts per minute (cpm) in patient serum to the cpm in the control pool. Inverse correlations were found between these ratios for each of the pseudomonas exoproducts and clinical scores; highest ratios occurred in patients showing the lowest clinical scores. These results confirm that proteases and exotoxin A of P. aeruginosa are produced in cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections due to P. aeruginosa and suggest that they may serve as significant virulence factors in these chronic infectious states.\\n\",\n",
       " 'It is our hypothesis that in cystic fibrosis there is a genetically determined specific deficiency in the activity of either the glandular kallikrein or in its activating enzyme, and that this defect is the primary defect in the disease.  The immediate consequence of either of these defects is the absence of kallidin and the resulting failure of reabsorption.  The fact that there may be mutations affecting distinct enzymes could account for the genetic heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis.  A consequence of a defective kallikrein system would be accumulation of a precursor related to the low molecular weight kininogen and we propose that this compound is the ciliary-dyskinesia factor.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cell-free culture medium from PHA-stimulated PBL cultures or long-term lymphoid cell lines from CF homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes, as well as serum from such individuals, can produce three distinct changes in the ciliary beat of rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelium: (1) increased beat frequency, (2) CD, and (3) ciliostasis.  The ability to produce both 1 and 2 seems to be characteristic for leukocyte cultures from CF genotypes: 46 of 49 CF cultures produced both effects, as compared with none of 16 cultures from normal controls and 1 of 10 from non-CF patient controls with bronchial asthma.  CTA was not specific for CF PBL cultures, since 13% of normal control and 60% of the non-CF patient control cultures produced ciliostasis.  Similar findings were obtained when serum from the same individuals or culture medium from long-term lymphoid cell lines was tested.  Using protein A from Staphylococcus aureus covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B as a reagent, we separated the CDAs present in serum and in culture medium from PBL and lymphoid cultures.  Protein A specifically adsorbs IgG and binds it under mild conditions at physiological pH.  The CDAs are noncovalently bound to IgG at physiological pH and can be co-purified with IgG.  The IgG-CDA complexes can be readily desorbed from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at pH 3.0, and under these conditions the CDAs are dissociated from IgG, retain all their activity, and can be separated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 or Sephadex G-200.  Three distinct activities were removed from serum or PBL cultures which showed both CDA and CTA, and two were obtained from samples which showed only CDA.  One CDA believed to be specific for CF (CF-CDA) was separated from CF serum and PBL or lymphoid cell culture medium.  This CF-CDA was complexed noncovalently to IgG (not subclass IgG3), had a molecular weight of 4000 to 6000, was stable as acid pH, was found in biological fluids from both homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, was shown not to be C3a (anaphylatoxin), did not require IgG for activity, and was positively charged at pH values more acidic than 8.0.\\n',\n",

       " 'Acid mucins in goblet cells of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of neonates and infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and without CF were measured by scanning microdensitometry after alcian blue staining according to the protocol of McCarthy and Reid (1963) which characterises four groups of acidic mucins. In CF infants over 6 mth of age, but not in controls, there was an increase along the gut from duodenum to ileum of both weakly acidic and strongly acidic sulphomucins. In the ileum the increase was in total mucins from 6 mth previously in the same CF patients and this difference could be accounted for by an increase of sialidase-resistant mucins. The increase in sulphomucins was more marked at the tip than at the base of the villi. In CF neonates there was significant difference in the quantities of acidic mucins. The question whether the mucins of CF are chemically abnormal or merely accumulated to an abnormal extent is probably best investigated by analysis of sialidase-resistant mucins and sulphomucins of the ileum and strongly acidic sulphomucins of the duodenum and jejunum in CF infants over 6 mth of age.\\n',\n",
       " 'A retrospective analysis of oral D-xylose tolerance tests in 435 pediatric patients was performed. A significant difference was found between 126 normal subjects and 47 untreated children with celiac disease one hour after load. The one-hour value was found to be more reliable than was fecal fat analysis in screening children for celiac disease. Sex, age, weight, and body surface did not influence the results of the one-hour value in the control subjects. Forty-eight children with cystic fibrosis had one-hour xylose levels within the normal range, but the means at 90, 120, and 180 minutes after load exceeded significantly (P less than 0.01) those of the controls. In a nonceliac group of 63 children with abnormally low xylose levels, almost all were found to have clinical conditions compatible with upper small bowel mucosal impairment. This study shows that a single estimation of xylose in blood one hour after load is a reliable index of small bowel mucosal function. It is a good screening test for celiac disease and small bowel disorders producing malabsorption in children.\\n',\n",

He \"feels\" that CF occurs more frequently than we have reported.  Our ten-year search in the Washington, D.C., area shows a minimum incidence of cystic fibrosis among black newborn infants as one per 17,000.  Since 1972, we have identified an additional four black patients with cystic fibrosis in black children.  This is consistent with the previously reported incidence of one in 17,000.

       " 'The synthetic peptide N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid is specifically cleaved by chymotrypsin to Bz-Ty and PABA. The liberated PABA is absorbed and excreted in the urine. Accordingly, PABA recovery reflects intraluminal chymotrypsin activity and is an index of exocrine pancreatic function. This test was evaluated in 24 patients with cystic fibrosis to determine its role in the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Cumulative percent PABA recovery in six hours was significantly lower in CF patients compared with the control group. No overlap was noted between the two groups. There was good correlation between PABA recovery, fecal chymotrypsin activity, and coefficient of fat absorption. These findings indicate that PABA recovery is significantly reduced in patients with CF and steatorrhea and may prove a practical and reliable test of pancreatic insufficiency.\\n',\n",

In patients with CF and in the healthy control subjects under 5 years of age with normal intestinal mucosa, no low lactase activity was found. In those patients with CF who were over 5 years of age, one group had high and one group had low lactase activity, as occurs in healthy Caucasian control subjects of the same age. This finding supports the view that in patients with CF, lactase deficiency is not related to the disease entity. In patients with or without CF who had the same degree of mucosal atrophy, the decrease of disaccharidase activities followed the same pattern, indicating that enzyme activities are affected to the same extent by the damage of the mucosa. In patients with CF with pancreatic insufficiency, the disaccharidase activities were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher when compared to those in control subjects of the same age and ethnic group, although the increase was not uniform in all patients with cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Hereditary pancreatitis\" is important for at least three reasons: (1) It is probably not an uncommon form of pancreatitis in children and young adults; (2) the course of the disorder may be chronic, with substantial long-term morbidity, including an apparently increased risk for pancreatic cancer; and (3) once having made the correct diagnosis, occurrence among siblings and/or offspring (and perhaps other relatives) of the proband may be expected.  Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant trait with apparently complete penetrance, though markedly variable expressivity.  It would be reasonable to point out that hereditary pancreatitis should be entertained whenever an alternative diagnosis is not documented, even without a positive family history. - We agree with the statement by Jordan and Ament in a recent article that \"acute pancreatitis is one of the rarer causes of abdominal pain in children and is among the least reported and characterized.\"  However, their discussion of this problem is surprisingly incomplete.  Familial pancreatitis, one of the most important causes of pancreatitis in childhood, is not even mentioned; cystic fibrosis is barely acknowledged.  These two conditions as well as hypolipoproteinemia and ascariasis (also not mentioned) should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatitis in children and of otherwise unexplained abdominal pain in this age group. - We appreciate the concern that we did not diagnose hereditary pancreatitis in any of our patients.  None of the ten patients with \"idiopathic pancreatitis\" had a family history of pancreatitis documented in their charts.  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is not a common cause of pancreatitis in our center.  We chose to omit ascariasis from our differential diagnosis because in the developed countries it is unlikely to be a common cause of pancreatitis.\\n',\n",

This study was performed to determine if defective activation of C3 to C9 by bacteria contributes to the pathogenesis of the recurrent pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.  When each of the bacteria was incubated in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis for 30 minutes, the consumption of available C3 was the same as in the sera of the control patients and of the two patients with chronic, severe bronchiectasis.  Based on the results of the present study, it is unlikely that defective activation of C3 to C9 contributes to the pathogenesis of the increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections of these patients.\\n\",\n",

Positive responses to MCh occurred in 51% of the patients with CF and 98% of those with asthma. There was a significant correlation between a positive response to MCh in CF and poor pulmonary function. There was no relationship between allergic rhinitis or positive allergen skin tests and a positive MCh response. Dose-response curves and time course to MCh challenge differed in CF and asthma. Bronchial hyperreactivity is thus common in CF but is different from that in asthma.\\n',\n",

In each pair, one sibling had advanced clinical disease, whereas the other sibling was in good clinical condition. Three in this latter group had no clinically apparent Pseudomonas bronchitis. In all cases, the average responses to Pseudomonas isolated from each sibling pair were lower in the sibling with advanced clinical disease. This difference was not observed in the responses to Staphylococcus. Normal plasma or plasma from patients with CF in good clinical condition does not restore the responses in patients with advanced clinical disease. However, plasma from patients with low or no responses to Pseudomonas inhibits the responses of responding siblings. A progressive specific lymphocyte unresponsiveness to Pseudomonas may play an important role in the increasing destructiveness of chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas infection in cystic fibrosis.\\n',\n",

Until the problem of communication of probability can be worked out, I would like to make some suggestions in trying to help those who are provided with probability data.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa seems to have an exclusive propensity for the respiratory tract and may appear at any age.

The patients include two of five children in one family and two of four in another. In a third family, one of five siblings has an intermediate sweat chloride concentration, but another has a typical fibrosis value (105 mEq/liter). One patient died of respiratory failure; results of an autopsy showed bronchiolectasis typical of cystic fibrosis, but minimal pancreatic changes.

Only three patients survived longer than one year after discharge. These results are much poorer than those reported for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of other causes probably because of the different natural history and response to therapy in CF. Patients with CF whose conditions progressively deteriorated despite optimal therapy and no longer respond to antibiotic and physical therapy are not good candidates for mechanical ventilation. The occasional patient with good baseline status in whom acute respiratory failure develops should be considered for assisted ventilation.\\n',\n",

In the 80% to 85% of patients with pancreatic involvement, the degree of involvement can vary greatly.

OEP and protease toxoid (PT) elicited IgE antibody response but elastase toxoid (ET) did not. Capacity of the OEP to produce IgE antibody was reduced remarkably by it's protease treatment, which suggested that the capacity lies in the protein portion of OEP. The w/o/w emulsion was less effective than Al(OH)3 gel in adjuvanticity to elicit IgE antibody response, but the emulsion enhanced the IgM and/or IgG antibody response to PT and maintained a constant level for a long period.

We have found increased amounts of this substance in the plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis.  We agree with the authors' conclusion that levels of linoleic acid are specifically related to P.G. production in children with cystic fibrosis.  It remains to be shown whether children with cystic fibrosis have a primary abnormality of fatty-acid metabolism or whether the observed disturbances of prostaglandin metabolism are secondary to malabsorption of dietary essential fatty acids.

In cystic fibrosis stimulation of exocrine glands produces abnormal reabsorption of ions, leading to the physiological abnormalities and clinical manifestations of the disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Burns and May proposed the following pattern for the bacteriology of cystic fibrosis: (1) Staphylococcus aureus is the initial bacterial pathogen, and damage caused by it renders the lungs susceptible to infection by other species.  (2) Control of S. aureus by antibiotics allows the influx of Haemophilus influenzae.  (3) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is introduced and continued chemotherapy encourages its establishment.  (4) P. aeruginosa supplants S. aureus and H. influenzae, becoming the sole pathogen.  I have examined these ideas by quantitative culture of sputum from 20 patients seen at the Cystic Fibrosis Treatment and Research Center, University of Oregon Health Sciences Center from 1965 to 1977.  The results accord with the original hypothesis of Burns and May.  In 13 of 20 patients the sputum bacterial flora changed as the hypothesis of Burns and May predicted.  This preliminary data suggests that one of the primary sputum abnormalities in cystic fibrosis may be increased Ca++ which makes the sputum susceptible to colonisation by S. aureus.  After infection the Ca++ concentration is reduced and the lung becomes susceptible to colonisation by other microorganisms including H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.\\n',\n",
       " 'We confirm that thymidine-requiring (thy-) Staphylococcus aureus strains are common in patients with cystic fibrosis.  In 7 months, we isolated Staph. aureus from 11 of 14 patients with C.F.  Despite long-term co-trimoxazole Staph. aureus tends to persist in the sputum even though isolates do not require thymidine at first and are trimethoprim-sensitive in vitro.  Staph. aureus is less commonly isolated, and of less significance, in most other chest conditions for which co-trimoxazole is given.  These factors may explain why thy- staphylococci are recognised more frequently in C.F. than in other diseases.\\n',\n",
       " '12 children with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) had lower levels of the essential fatty acid, linoleic acid, in plasma and in red blood cells, than did control children, and production of prostaglandin F2alpha (P.G.F2alpha) was higher than in controls. After 10 months of oral linoleic-acid supplementation in 6 of the children with C.F., the linoleic-acid levels in plasma, red cells, and platelets were higher and P.G.F2alpha production was lower than in the 6 children with C.F. who received a placebo lipid. Prostaglandin F2alpha is associated with bronchoconstriction and its increased production in children with C.F. might be causally related to their chronic pulmonary disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dr Freed and Dr Buckley have shown that a lectin, concanavalin A (Con A), causes severe rhinitis, sinusitis, and increased mucus secretion when inhaled by man or small-intestinal colic, foul-smelling flatus, and mucus-coated stools if ingested.  It is somewhat surprising that the authors suggest that a suitable inhaled or ingested lectin may be useful in treating patients with cystic fibrosis, since the very symptoms produced by the ingested lectin resemble those associated with the disease.  A more attractive recommendation would be for patients with cystic fibrosis to avoid substances containing lectins such as Con A to avoid stimulating additional mucus release.  The underlying pathogenetic defect in cystic fibrosis may be inappropriate, excessive stimuli by lectin-like substances.  These observations suggest that the increase in the protein content of lymphocytes is stimulated by a plasma factor present in patients with cystic fibrosis and in carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene.  These observations, plus those of Freed and Buckley, might suggest that cystic fibrosis is a disease involving a plasma factor with lectin or Con A-like activity which stimulates the secretion of mucus and increases the enzyme content of circulating or cultured lymphocytes. - Professor Lieberman confuses cause with effect.  If there is excessive mucus production in cystic fibrosis we suggest that this is because the secretion is so difficult to remove from the mucosal surface.  Goblet cells and mucus glands become clogged with hyperviscid mucus which, not being removed, stimulates further mucus production.  To deprive the patient of the mucotractive value of his dietary lectins would be a therapeutic mischief equivalent to prescribing a cough-suppresant for a productive cough.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cystic fibrosis is inherited by single autosomal transmission.  That, at least, is the general view; but from time to time other suggestions are offered.  Stern et al. describe what they believe may be a genetic variant.  The affected patients, they suggest, are homozygous for a portion of a closely linked multigenic cystic fibrosis locus, or have modifier genes ameliorating the pancreatic and sweat lesions.  Do these patients really have CF?  And, if so, are Stern et al. justified in suggesting that they differ genetically from the \"classic\" CF patient?  This hypothesis may not be correct but, until we understand the basic fundamental defect, it may be unwise to divide CF into different genetic types on the basis of clinical variations.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dr Smalley and her colleagues rightly stress that the commonest reason for abnormally high sweat-electrolyte levels, apart from cystic fibrosis, is faulty technique.  A further cause of false-positive results, and potentially more important than the list of rare disorders usually cited, is atopic dermatitis.  Dr M. Ampola and I investigated ten children with eczema at the Tufts New England Medical Center, Boston, and found higher sodium and/or chloride levels in sweat obtained from affected skin than in sweat from normal skin in the same individuals.  In four of these atopic children, levels within the diagnostic range for cystic fibrosis were obtained (above 60 mmol/l).\\n',\n",

The altered fatty-acid composition of serum-lipid fractions seems to be a secondary consequence of the pancreatic insufficiency commonly associated with C.F. disease and not a direct metabolic defect as some have suggested.\\n',\n",

It is based on measuring pancreatic trypsin in a sample of faeces collected on to filter paper on the 4th or 5th day of life.  The false-negative rate of the new test has not yet been determined, but older children with CF and pancreatic achylia all gave abnormal results when tested.  The disadvantage of the test, as with the meconium albumin test, is that about 10% of children with CF are said not to have pancreatic achylia.  Whilst the method needs more extensive evaluation, it appears technically more satisfactory than others so far described.\\n',\n",

Here we report that trypsin-binding IgG (TbIgG) is present in 80% of CF patients and in 30% of their mothers, but not in 97% of normal controls or in other relatives of CF patients.

The cephalosporins serve as alternative agents principally for their antistaphylococcal activity. We are urgently in need of a potent antibiotic agent against P. aeruginosa that can be given by the oral route. The TMP-SMX combination is a potent chemotherapeutic agent that can be administered by the oral route.

Many technical problems remain to be solved before the test can be endorsed without reservation. Because the test, as currently constituted, does not identify all potential subjects for further testing who might have CF, it should not be made mandatory. It is, however, better than other available screening methods for CF and can be praised for that benefit. The concept has indicated a valuable new direction for mass-screening possibilities and perhaps can, by future modification, be made sensitive enough to warrant universal usage.\\n',\n",
       " 'The width of the right paratracheal stripe (RPS) has been established in normal adults but not in normal children. The thymus and great vessels are relatively larger in children than in adults and could obscure or widen the RPS.

The width of the RPS in normal children, 0.5 to 3.0 mm, is slightly less than in adults. From this study of normal children and our subsequent experience with pediatric patients, we conclude that in a child an RPS 4 mm or wider is reliable evidence of disease affecting the trachea, mediastinum, or pleura.\\n',\n",

The recent report by Scholey et al. confirms that CFP is present in the majority of CF sera and that it can be detected by our methods.  Before discussing whether the CFP can be used as a diagnostic marker for cystic fibrosis, we would like to examine more closely some of the requirements of the method which seemed to have been critical for the detection of CFP by Scholey et al.  We would like to point out that Scholey and his coworkers adhered closely to most of our guidelines during their attempts to detect CFP.  The exact nature of CFP and the other ciliary dyskinesia factors is only partially known, and all aspects of their metabolism are not yet understood.  Therefore, it may be some time before we comprehend the incomplete concordance found between CFP and the pathogenesis of CF.\\n',\n",
       " 'A ciliostatic factor has been isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) saliva by dialyzing it from purified alpha-amylase prepared by a glycogen-complex method. This method of isolating the CF factor is an improvement over the previously employed heparin procedure. The activity of the isolated factor is proportional with concentration using the oyster gill ciliostatic assay and in its inhibition of mammalian glycogen debranching enzyme. The ciliostatic action of the factor can be reversed by heparin under certain conditions. The type of inhibition of the debranching enzyme by the isolated CF factor indicates that its chemical structure is similar to that observed with hydroxyalkylamines and polyamine metabolites. Physical properties of the isolated factor indicate that it is of low molecular weight and is labile as a function of pH and temperature. At neutral pH the conditions under which it is maintained have a direct effect on the length of time that it is stable.\\n',\n",
       " 'Protease activity in cultivated human skin fibroblasts has been quantitated using 4-methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate (MUGB), an active site titrant of trypsin-like proteases (7). The reaction of the proteases with MUGB was complete in 1 hr, inhibited both by benzamidine and (p-nitrophenyl)-p\\'-guanidinobenzoate, but not by p- hydroxymercuribenzoate. The extent of reaction was proportional to protein concentration and independent of MUGB concentration. This activity was present in the particulate fraction of the cell. The mean \"titre\" values (nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone released per mg protein) of the proteases in fibroblasts from eight controls (N), 8 obligate heterozygotes (H), and 14 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were: N, 1.27 +/- 0.11; H, 0.82 +/- 0.12; CF, 0.66 +/- 0.10. The differences in the \"titre\" values for N:CF and N:H were significant (p less than 0.001) as were those for H:CF (p less than 0.01). The mean \"titre\" value obtained for cultivated control amniotic fluid cells was 1.29 +/- 0.17. These data indicate a reduction in the MUGB- reactive proteases in skin fibroblasts derived from patients with CF when compared either to control or to obligate heterozygotes. These data are consistent with our earlier suggestion (11, 15) that decreased proteolytic levels in the tissues and fluids of patients with CF may be a generalized phenomenon.\\n',\n",

       " 'Adenylate cyclase activity was measured in membrane preparations of cultured fibroblasts from controls and patients with cystic fibrosis. Enzyme activity increased as the transition from exponential growth to confluence occurred; sodium fluoride-stimulated activity more markedly displayed this relationship than basal cyclase activity. The in vitro addition of spermine (1 X 10(-6) to 2 X 10(-3) M) to membrane preparations caused inhibition of basal and sodium fluoride- stimulated enzyme activity, with 50% inhibition of basal activity occurring at 10(-6) M spermine. Spermidine (10(-4) M) caused 15--25% inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The increase in fibroblast adenylate cyclase activity during the transition from exponential growth was comparable in cells obtained from cystic fibrosis patients and control subjects. Basal and sodium-fluoride stimulated adenylate cyclase activity as well as inhibition of this enzyme activity by spermidine and spermine were undistinguishable between the different cell genotypes. A potential modulation of cellular proliferative activity through polyamine interaction with the adenylate cyclase system is postulated.\\n',\n",

Their work appeared to establish the presence of a definitive marker for CF serum in the form of a protein band that was not present in normal serum.  We tried to repeat their work and found that the background color of the fresh electropherograms made it rather difficult to detect unequivocally the presence or absence of bands in the appropriate pH region in CF vs. control serum.  However, when the gels were photographed using Kodak Panatomic X film and a Wratten 25 A red filter, the color response and contrast of the film eliminated this interference to a great extent and it was much easier to detect the putative band.  We agree partially with the observations of Wilson and Fudenberg, but would like to stress that the technique is not a diagnostic test.\\n',\n",
       " 'The chronically reserpinized rat has been proposed as an animal model for cystic fibrosis on the basis of morphologic and secretory alterations in the submaxillary gland and of abnormalities in pulmonary secretions.  In this investigation, the volume and composition of pancreatic juice from reserpine treated rats (0.5 mg/kg/day) have been compared to those of untreated controls after stimulation with purified cholecystokinin (0.1 microgram/kg body weight) and with crude and purified preparations of secretin (6 microns/100 g body weight) infused iv for 30-min periods.  The results demonstrate that the treated animals secreted a significantly lower volume of pancreatic juice after stimulation with these secretagogues.  Flow rates were also significantly reduced after stimulation with cholecystokinin and crude secretin. Protein and amylase outputs in response to cholecystokinin were smaller than in control animals after unrestritced feedings, but greater after a 24-hr fast.  Total bicarbonate output was also reduced after stimulation with either crude or purified secretin and the normal excretion patterns for bicarbonate and chloride were either absent of reversed in the secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice of the treated animals.  Whole pancreas homogenates from the treated animals showed significant increases in Ca++ and protein content.  These results indicate that chronic administration of reserpine alters the secretion of water, protein, and bicarbonate from the rat pancreas and that it affects several of the exocrine glands involved in cystic fibrosis.  These findings lend support to the concept of an animal model for the human disease.  The chronic administration of reserpine to rats has been shown to induce alterations in salivary and pulmonary secretions which resemble those seen in patients with cystic fibrosis.  The concept of an animal model has been proposed on the basis of these observations. The pancreas is another exocrine gland prominently involved in cystic fibrosis and if it can be demonstrated that reserpine administration also induces alterations in pancreatic secretion, the concept of the animal model would be strengthened considerably.\\n',\n",
       " 'Alpha-amylase activity and protein concentration of cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate heterozygote (H), and normal (N) saliva have been evaluated with respect to genotype, age, sex and clinical status. \"Factors\" present in CF saliva had no detectable effect on salivary amylase activity under reaction conditions optimized for both competitive and noncompetitive inhibition.  Tris [tris-(hydoxy-methyl)aminomethane] inhibited amylase activity with a Ki = 59 plus or minus 10 mM, but CF \"factors\" had no detectable effect on either substrate or Tris binding to alpha-amylase. Alpha-amylase concentrationand protein content of CF saliva had bimodal distributions.  Thirty-six percent of the CF patients were found to be amylase hypersecretors, with amylase concentration 3 or more SD above the N mean.  Amylase hypersecretion was marginally correlated with both genetic factors (with parent values, P = 0.075) and clinical status (with Scwachman scores, P = 0.068).  All the hypersecretors were in the 14-24 year age group.  Amylase concentration for this age was significant higher in CF samples (mean plus or minus SD), 82 plus or minus 37 starch units/ml (n =  12), than in N samples, 33 plus or minus 17 starch unites/ml (n = 13), as measured by the Student t-test (P < 0.001).  Salivary protein content of 14- to 24-year-old CF males was elevated compared to all other groups [1.57 plus or minus 0.76 (n = 5) vs. 0.63 plus or minus  0.47 (n = 20); Student t-test, P < 0.005].  Mean specific activity of male saliva dropped sharply as age increased from 10-15 years, from over 200 to less than 75 starch units/mg protein.  Mean normal female specific activity values were essentially constant [97 plus or minus 50 (n = 18) starch units/mg protein] from 5-30 years of age.  CF male specific activity values decreased similarly to the N male values from preadolescence to adolescence, but the mean CF female values peaked later, at 17 years, with a maximum of 171 plus or minus 58 (n = 4).  This is significantly higher than all the other groups in the 16- to 20-year age range: 63 plus or minus 30 (n = 9), P < 0.005.  These data emphasize the need for age- and sex-matched controls in all studies of salivary composition.  We were unable to detect any effect of a salivary CF factor on the enzymatic activity of alpha-amylase.  Hypersecretion of salivary alpha-amylase was observed in 36% of CF patients.  This may reflect alterations in secretory function basic to CF, or be secondary to the disease process and result from decreased secretion from the mucous salivary glands or deterioration of pancreatic function.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ultrastructural and cytochemical observations indicate that both cystic fibrosis (CF) sera and calcium ionophore A23187 induce a swelling or an increase in the size and possibly the number of secondary lysosomes and an increase in mucus secretion in epithelium of the rabbit tracheal bioassay system. Extended incubation of the rabbit tracheal explants with either CF or control sera produces a cytotoxic effect on the tracheal epithelium, but only after the termination of the normal bioassay time period. Comparative ultrastructural study of the effect of both CF sera and calcium ionophore A23187 on the rabbit tracheal bioassay system indicates that increased membrane permeability to calcium may be important in the production of the ciliary dyskinesia response by CF serum factor(s) in the rabbit tracheal bioassay system.\\n',\n",

       " \"Total serum amylase was determined in 83 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (14 of whom had no steatorrhea), 21 control patients, and 6 patients with Shwachman's syndrome. Patients with CF who had steatorrhea and therefore lacked pancreatic function had the same serum levels pre- and postprandially as the control subjects, whereas patients without steatorrhea and, therefore, with evidence of pancreatic function, had significantly higher levels. The patients with Shwachman's syndrome had significantly lower total serum amylase than the three other patient groups. Only the patients with Shwachman's syndrome demonstrated a significant postprandial rise in activity. Only the salivary isoenzyme was detected in patients with Shwachman's syndrome or CF and apparently absent pancreatic function, whereas CF patients without steatorrhea had both salivary and pancreatic isoenzymes. These results demonstrate that patients with CF have an increase in circulating salivary amylase isoenzyme whereas patients with Shwachman's syndrome do not. The increase probably reflects an autonomic hyperstimulation of salivary secretion which is primary to CF, and unrelated to the state of pancreatic activity.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Calcium-ATPase activity (Mg2+-dependent Ca2+-ATPase, ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) in erythrocyte membrane preparations from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients was greatly reduced compared to erythrocyte membranes from control subjects. The Km for calcium was found to be similar in the two groups; however, the Vmax, the maximal rate of activation of the Ca2+-ATPase, is reduced by 50% in the erythrocyte membrane preparations of the CF patients (P less than 0.001). In contrast, the Mg2+-ATPase activity of erythrocyte membranes from CF patients was unchanged compared to the control subjects. No difference in the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in erythrocyte membranes from CF patients compared to control patients could be observed. This indicates that the Ca2+-ATPase activity noted in CF erythrocytes is not part of a generalized membrane or membrane-bound enzyme alteration. It remains to be determined whether this alteration in Ca2+-ATPase activity is directly related to a defect in calcium transport in these cells and is a generalized phenomenon in CF present in cell types more directly involved in secretion.\\n',\n",

There was no significant correlation of results with clinical score, and no differences in the CF group attributable to medications or presence of pancreatic insufficiency.  CF heterozygotes had mean stimulation ratio and mean net isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP intermediate betweem normal and CF.  There were no statistically significant differences among normal subjects, CF patients, and CF heterozygotes in basal cAMP or prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP.  Purified mononuclear cells from five normal persons and seven CF homozygotes had the same basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP, but isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was markedly depressed (P < 0.01) in the CF cells.  Granulocytes from six normal persons and nine CF patients also had the same basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP, but isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was decreased (P < 0.05) in the CF samples.  These results clearly demonstrate a difference between normal and CF leukocytes in cAMP response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.  The diminised cAMP response to beta-adrenergic stimulation in CF is probably related to the presence of a CF gene, and may interact with other genetic abnormalities to produce the clinical syndrome of CF.\\n\",\n",

The progression in airway obstruction was measured by change in serial measurements of maximal midexpiratory flow (MMEF), from which a regression equation of MMEF against time was obtained for each individual. Changes in MMEF value with or without therapy were compared in patients matched for severity of disease as indicated by initial MMEF values. For the group as a whole no differences were found in the progression of the airway obstruction whether the patients received mist tent therapy or not. This therapy failed to benefit any of the groups of children with CF who had early, moderate, or advanced airway obstruction as judged from their initial MMEF value. It is concluded that nocturnal mist tent therapy neither decreases airway obstruction nor prevents its progression in children with CF.\\n',\n",
       " 'There is considerable dispute regarding the prevalence of asthma in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We studied 50 patients with CF and compared their responsiveness to inhaled histamine with that of asthmatic children. The incidence of positive responses to inhaled histamine was 24% in the patients with CF and more than 90% in the asthmatic patients. We found no correlation, in the patients with CF, between the histamine response and several indexes of atopy (clinical allergic disease and positive allergen skin tests). Positive responders to histamine were not evenly distributed over the disease spectrum of CF. Instead, positive responses occurred only in those patients whose prechallenge pulmonary function was abnormal. We conclude that the heightened bronchial reactivity in patients with CF reflects the severity of their underlying lung disease rather than the presence of coexistent asthma.\\n',\n",
       " 'A 21-year-old woman with a history of chronic lung disease secondary to cystic fibrosis (CF) developed an acute hemorrhagic retinopathy during exposure to moderately high altitude. Although retinal hemorrhages are known to occur in patients with CF, we speculate that the retinopathy in this case was partially related to altitudinal change and that patients with chronic hypoxemia may be predisposed to high-altitude retinopathy at much lower altitudes.\\n',\n",
       " 'The rat jejunum bioassay has been shown to be capable of identifying both the cystic fibrotic homozygote and heterozygote and therefore would appear to have great potential as a screening test for the latter.  It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry into the cell.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mg2+-dependent Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined in membrane preparations of fibroblasts grown from skin biopsies of cystic fibrosis patients and age-matched controls. This enzyme was stimulated by increasing free calcium concentrations with an apparent Kdiss for calcium of approximately 45 micron. Although there was a great deal of variation in Ca2+-ATPase activity observed between individual strains, there was a significant decrease in the maximal activation of the Ca2+-ATPase in membrane preparations of fibroblasts obtained from cystic fibrosis patients compared to the controls (P less than 0.05). This observation indicates that decreased Ca2+- ATPase activity is a generalized phenomenon in cystic fibrosis found in more than one cell-type. This decrease in Ca2+-ATPase activity may have a number of implications that may explain some of the manifestations of the disease.\\n',\n",
       " 'Little has been published on cystic fibrosis (CF) in Whites in southern Africa, and no figures as to incidence exist. A register of CF patients, their parents (obligatory carriers), siblings, uncles, aunts and first cousins (potential carriers) has been compiled for southern Africa. The degree of co-operation shown by colleagues and by families whose addresses have been provided by them, and possible reasons for non-co-operation are discussed. From the numbers and birth dates of patients a rough estimate of the incidence in the Republic of South Africa, South West Africa and Rhodesia has been made. In all three regions, but especially in South Africa, incidence is likely to have been underestimated. Details available from the register include the number of CF patients alive and dead, those who presented with meconium ileus, the number of affected patients per family, consanguinity among the parents or grandparents, the frequency with which identical surnames were encountered, and the sibship sizes of all those on the register. Towns and districts with a population rich in the CF gene are mentioned. The number of potential carriers has been determined, so that they can be screened when a practicable detection test is devised. The register has answered a number of questions about CF in southern Africa. It has focused attention on the disease in the region and played a major catalytic role in the formation of the Southern African Cystic Fibrosis Association.\\n',\n",
       " 'Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were investigated for mucociliary clearance (with and without stimulation by terbutaline), clinical picture, ventilatory function and ultrastructure of cilia. The results were compared with those of patients with congenitally immotile cilia (immotile-cilia syndrome). Mucociliary clearance could be demonstrated in all the seven CF patients who succeeded in inhaling the test aerosol. Ciliary ultrastructure from a deceased CF patient was normal. Patients with the immotile cilia syndrome had no substantial clearance and defective cilia. The CF patients coughed more during the clearance measurements than any other group studied earlier, and their coughing was effective. One patient succeeded in avoiding coughing in both measurements and had faster clearance when he got terbutaline than when he got the vehicle. Although younger, the CF patients tended to be more obstructed in their lungs and more handicapped than the patients suffering from the immotile-cilia syndrome. The latter patients had more discomfort from rhinitis, sinusitis and otitis than had the CF patients. An impairment of the mucociliary transport rate is hence unlikely to be a primary pathogenic factor for the respiratory tract disease in CF patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'Two major classes of lipoproteins, low density and high density, are decreased in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis; major apoproteins are also decreased. Since essential fatty acids and certain fat-soluble vitamins depend on lipoproteins for transport in the serum, knowledge of lipoprotein levels in cystic fibrosis patients could prove valuable in understanding (i) the basis for the abnormally low serum levels of these fatty acids and vitamins and (ii) the effects of therapies involving these molecules.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are more resistant to dexamethasone toxicity than are normal cells. We now report that, when fibroblasts cultured from obligate CF heterozygotes are exposed to dexamethasone, they have an intermediate survival compared to normal and homozygous CF cells. When dexamethasone survival was tested on cells from four patients undergoing amniocentesis, cells from a woman at risk of producing a child with CF showed significant dexamethasone resistance, similar to that of fibroblasts derived from lnown CF homozygotes; the other amniotic cell specimens showed dexamethasone sensitivity similar to that of normal skin fibroblasts. These data suggest that the dexamethasone resistance previously observed in skin fibroblasts may also be useful in the prenatal diagnosis of CF.\\n',\n",
       " 'Free and conjugated [14C]spermidine were measured in plasma samples from normal individuals and cystic fibrosis patients. Within 4 minutes, the 14C-labeled material in the plasma from normal individuals was 70 percent conjugated compared to no detectable conjugation by cystic fibrosis patients. Further, the patients excreted only 11 to 13 percent of the [14C]spermidine in their urine within 72 hours whereas normal excretion was 60 to 76 percent. In both cases, the labeled material was in a conjugated form.\\n',\n",
       " 'In previous studies, cystic fibrosis (CF) fibroblasts were demonstrated to be resistant to the cytotoxic effects of ouabain, dexamethasone, and the sex hormones, dihydrotestosterone, 17beta- estradiol, and progesterone. We now show that CF fibroblasts also exhibit greatly increased resistance to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP), as well as to isoproterenol and theophylline, drugs which are known to increase endogenous levels of cAMP. CF cells were also shown to have normal amounts of (3H)cAMP binding to protein kinase as well as normal amounts of cAMP- stimulated protein kinase activity. Phosphodiesterase in CF cells was also found to be stimulated by cAMP to the same degree as in normal cells. These findings suggest that there is no detectable protein kinase deficiency in CF cells. cf cells thus appear to be unlike some cAMP-resistant mutants described by others which are defective in protein kinase activity and cAMP regulation of phosphodiesterase levels. The cross-resistance of CF fibroblasts to ouabain, steroid hormones, and cAMP may provide a unique opportunity to study the biochemical events involved in the metabolism of these drugs as well as the basic biochemical defect in a common human genetic disease.\\n',\n",

       " 'The evidence shows that the pathology of cystic fibrosis (CF) is related to mucoid secretions. Consequently, the question of what governs the viscosity of mucus is examined in detail. It is generally agreed that the mucin gel consists of polyanionic glycoproteins and a hitherto unidentified poly cationic cross-linking protein. It is proposed that larger amounts of polycations increase viscosity and, in excess, cause mucus to become a polycation. As these compounds are known to inhibit the ductal reabsorption of sodium, the two principal aspects of the pathology of CF can be related to the same mechanism. The mucus globule membrane (MGM) has been proposed as the cross- linking protein.\\n',\n",
       " 'On 100 sputum specimens selected from patients suffering  from chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, asthma, and cystic fibrosis total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content has been related to macroscopic type, to total dry weight yield, and to the apparent viscosity of the secretion at 1350 s-1: since DNA may be present, either as fibres or within cells, in one-third of the specimens the contribution of each form to the apparent viscosity was assessed. The effect on sputum viscosity of the addition of DNA in vitro has also been studied. Whereas between mucoid, mucopurulent, and purulent macroscopic types a significant difference in total DNA and dry weight yield has been found, viscosity was not significantly correlated with purulence. Similarly, the concentration of either cells or fibres correlated significantly with total DNA but not with viscosity. The in vitro addition of DNA to sputum caused a significant increase in its viscosity, and reasons for the differences between the iv vivo and in vitro effect are discussed. Certain constituents of purulent sputum tend to increase viscosity and others to reduce it, and the influence of these varies in the several diseases studied.\\n',\n",
       " 'In 94 children suffering from cystic fibrosis, no abnormal frequencies of HLA markers of the A and B locus were observed in comparison with the distribution of these antigens in control series. Furthermore, the HLA genotypes of seven pairs of diseased sibs are incompatible with the hypothesis of a closed linkage between CF--an autosomal recessive transmitted disease--and HLA.\\n',\n",
       " 'In order to study the disposition which is thought to be latent in chronic pancreatitis, we investigated the sweat chloride concentration of 95 normal subjects, 43 cases of chronic pancreatitis, 12 cases of cholelithiasis, 15 cases of peptic ulcers, 16 cases of hepatic diseases and 23 cases of diabetes mellitus with the sweat test, using the method of pilocarpine iontophoresis. We obtained the following results. (1) In normal subjects, the sweat chloride concentration was inclined to rise gradually with age from childhood to adulthood; the mean value of sweat chloride concentration was 30.0 mEq/liter in adults from 20 years old, and the upper limit was about 60 mEq/liter. (2) The mean value of sweat chloride concentration was 60.0 mEq/liter in chronic calcifying pancreatitis; this value was markedly higher than that of control subjects of the same age (p is less than 0.001). (3) The mean value of sweat chloride concentration in cholelithiasis, peptic ulcer and hepatic diseases did not differ significantly from control subjects. The mean value of sweat chloride concentration in diabetes mellitus was significantly higher than that of control subjects (p is less than 0.01), but was significantly lower than that in chronic pancreatitis (p is less than 0.01). (4) It was supposed that some cases of chronic pancreatitis have a congenital disposition toward abnormal secretion of sweat glands and epithelium in the pancreatic duct, resembling cystic fibrosis, and this disposition leads easily to pancreatic disorders when the individual is exposed to various external factors.\\n',\n",
       " 'The aim of this paper is to report in detail the clinical and pathological observations in a case of cystic fibrosis showing widely disseminated intravascular sickling.  To the best of our knowledge no case of cystic fibrosis associated with sickle cell trait has been reported in the literature.  A six month old infant who was diagnosed to have cystic fibrosis and sickle cell trait was presented and the literature was reviewed for this coexistence.\\n',\n",
       " 'The diseases of respiratory system are nowadays one of the important medical, economical and social problems of modern civilization. A common symptom of these diseases regardless of their etiology, character, klinical manifestation and morphological findings is hypersecretion of bronchial sputum. Tracheobronchial mucus is produced by mucous bronchial glands and goblet cells. This mucus represents at physiological condition about 5 micrometer thick cover on mucous of nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi up to terminal bronchioles. Protective function of mucus cover resposes in mechanical and humoral barrier and also in removing the inhaled particles and their transport to the upper part of the respiratory system. In spite of the fact, that bronchial secretion has an important role in protective mechanism and in thermal and water exchange of respiratory tract, this secretion is not sufficiently scrutinized mainly of children yet.\\n',\n",
       " \"Sweat from 8 'rusters' and 8 control persons was examined for its sodium concentration. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis of pilocarpine on the distal forearm. In no case did the concentrations exceed the normal upper limit for this procedure, and no difference was found between the two groups. In this way the study failed to confirm earlier reports of elevated sodium chloride concentrations in sweat from 'rusters'. Proposals of a relationship between 'rusters' and patients with pancreatic cystic fibrosis were not substantiated. Hyperhidrosis of the palms and volar surfaces of the fingers was present in all 'rusters'. This seemed to be the main cause of the corrosive tendency, and patients referred for palmar hyperhidrosis were found to produce corrosion similar to the 'rusters'. Topical application of aluminium chloride hexahydrate in a 25% solution in absolute ethyl alcohol proved effective against both hyperhidrosis and the corrosive tendency.\\n\",\n",
       " '111 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), aged 7 months to 29 years, were examined to detect inflammatory middle ear diseases. 35% had a history of one or more attacks of acute otitis media, an incidence at the same level as in non-CF patients. None had chronic suppurative otitis. Only 4 out of the 88 patients able to cooperate in audiometry had a hearing impairment. In 2, the hearing loss was perceptive, in 3 very mild, and in the fourth case, moderately severe. The middle ear pressure was measured in 108 patients, in 86 of whom it proved normal. In 15 patients the middle ear pressure was lower than--100 mmH2O, indicating tubal occlusion, and in 7 patients the impedance minimum was lacking, indicating an accumulation of mucus. These 7 patients (6%) had secretory otitis media. Nasal polyps were or had been present in 32%. There was no correlation between nasal polyps and tubal occlusion or secretory otitis. The incidence of inflammatory middle ear diseases in CF patients was in the same range as in non-CF patients, a finding at variance with some previous investigations showing middle ear pathology in 25--48%.\\n',\n",
       " 'Serum from normal persons and from 133 cystic fibrosis patients was examined for precipitins against faecal bacteria (E. coli and B. fragilis) and against P. aeruginosa by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis.  27% of the normal sera contained 1-2 precipitins against E. coli, 16% contained one precipitin against B. fragilis and 6% contained one precipitin against P. aeruginosa.  In sera from cystic fibrosis patients, there was a significantly increased prevalence of precipitins against E. coli (76%), B. fragilis (38%) and P. aeruginosa (63%), and the mean number of precipitins against each of these bacteria was 3 (range: 1-12), 1.4 (range: 1-4), and 16 (range: 1-60), respectively.  Increased numbers of precipitins against P. aeruginosa were correlated with chronic lung infection caused by this species and with poor prognosis, whereas such associations were not revealed as regards precipitins against the two other bacterial species.  Increased numbers of precipitins against E. coli and B. fragilis were significantly associated with increased numbers of precipitins against P. aeruginosa.  It is suggested that this association is due to immune reactions in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased absorption of antigens from the gut.\\n',\n",
       " 'The coexistence of cystic fibrosis (CF) and coeliac disease (CD) is reported in eight children, the odds against this occurring in the same child being 1:2 million to 1:5.9 million.  In Sweden, it would be around 1:3 million (incidence of CF 1:3000 and of CD 1:1000). The coexistence of these two diseases is thought to be chance, although CF might predispose to the development of CD.  In a 10-year period (with 33405 live births), we observed three children with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and small intestine dysfunction.\\n',\n",
       " 'Although the mechanism proposed by Dr Katznelson for the increased intracranial pressure observed in three infants with cystic fibrosis cannot be discounted, another explanation is possible.  It has been reported previously that a deficiency of vitamin A may predispose to development of increased intracranial pressure and bulging fontanelles in cystic fibrosis.  Finally, it is somewhat difficult to understand how such marked airway obstruction which produced increased intracranial pressure could occur with preservation of arterial blood gases. - Vitamin A and carotene blood levels were not determined in our cases and therefore obviously this possibility cannot be excluded, at least in two of the cases.  Dr Taussig\\'s suggestion that the improvement in the intracranial pressure in our cases was really the result of the \"unknowing\" associated administration of vitamin A and not to the improvements in the pulmonary status, as I proposed, fails to note the clinical observation that there had been a \"rise and fall\" in the bulge of the fontanel concomitantly with the increase and decrease of respiratory obstruction signs.  As to the question of the severity of airway obstruction, the clinical reversible picture of severe tachypnea with poor air entry, clear lung fields on X-ray with overdistended lungs and small heart appear most suggestive of airway obstruction in C.F.\\n',\n",
       " 'Serum and sputum sol phase from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined for occurrence and titres of precipitins against Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel. The patients had from four to nine H. influenzae precipitins in serum and in most cases fewer precipitins in sputum, but, on an average, there was no difference between the titres of the antibodies in serum and sputum. Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species, notably those of the Haemophilus genus. S. aureus precipitins were generally found in higher numbers in serum than in sputum, but, on an average, the titre of the precipitins in sputum was higher than in serum. Three of the precipitins were detectable only in sputum and not in serum, and one of these is a S. aureus-specific precipitin. Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species, and these antibodies were often present in sputum in much higher titres than in the corresponding sera. Antibodies against teichoic acid of the S. aureus cell wall could not be demonstrated in sputum, while they were present in 22 sera. The possible role of the local pulmonary humoral immune response in protective immunity and in the pathology of the lung disease in CF is discussed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Eleven cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected in the lungs with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa and presenting multiple precipitins in serum against this bacterium (CF + P) and 10 CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection (CF-P) had their serum and sputum sol phase specimens examined for antibodies of the IgA and IgG classes against surface antigens of P. aeruginosa by means of an indirect immunofluorescence technique. Both the IgA and IgG antibody titres demonstrated in serum and sputum of the CF + P patients were significantly higher than in those of the CF-P patients (p less than 0.01). The titre of IgA antibodies in the sputum was higher than in serum in 3 cases indicating local pulmonary production of specific IgA antibodies. The role of the demonstrated antibodies in the local pulmonary immune defense mechanisms and the possible patogenesis of the pulmonary tissue damage in CF patients is discussed.\\n',\n",
       " '14 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected with mucoid P. aeruginosa and presenting multiple precipitins in serum against this bacterium (CF + P) and 13 CF patients without P. aeruginosa infection (CF-P) had their plasma and sputum sol phase examined for albumin, Clq. C3/C3c, C4 and C5 by means of electroimmunoassays. Their sputum sol phase was examined also for factor B by rocketimmunoelectrophoresis. C3c was demonstrated in the sputum sol phase but significantly more frequent (p less than 0.01) among the CF + P patients than among the CF-P patients. Factor B was also demonstrated in the sputum sol phase, but no significant difference in frequency could be demonstrated between the CF + P and the CF-P patients. None of the results indicated that a local pulmonary production of complement factors took place. Complement activation was significantly (p less than 0.01) associated with inflammation expressed as increased (formula: see text). The results show the importance of complement mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of pulmonary tissue damage in patients with CF and support the concept of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection as an immune complex disease in CF patients.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sera from 89 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 88 control persons were examined for the occurrence of rheumatoid factors (RF) of the IgG, IgA and IgM classes by an indirect immunofluorescence method and by the latex fixation slide test. The prevalence of RF-IgG was significantly higher (88%) (p less than 0.0005) among the CF patients than among the control persons (7%), while no difference was found between the two groups with regard to RF of the IgA or IgM classes. Fifty-five of the CF patients had chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in their lungs and two or more precipitins against these bacteria in their sera determined by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. These CF patients did not differ from the 34 CF patients without chronic P. aeruginosa infection, neither with regard to prevalence nor titer of RFs, but there was a positive correlation between the number of P. aeruginosa precipitins in the 55 chronically infected CF patients and their titers of IgG-RF. Nineteen CF patients were examined also for RFs, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-DNA antibodies in their sputum sol phase and corresponding sera. RFs were demonstrated in the sputum sol phase from 6 of the patients by the latex fixation test, whereas their sera were negative in this test, possibly indicating a local production of RF. Positive reactions for ANA and anti-DNA antibodies were found in 7 and 10 of the sputa respectively, and in higher titers than in the corresponding sera, also suggesting a local production. Titers of autoantibodies in sputum were low and no difference was found between patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection and patients without P. aeruginosa infection. The possible role of autoantibodies in the patogenesis of pulmonary tissue damage in CF patients is discussed.\\n',\n",

The second part of this chapter consists of reviews of some of the more common diseases producing chronic airway obstruction in infancy and childhood.  Patient evaluation topics discussed include history and physical examination and laboratory studies. Therapeutic principles in the management of chronic obstructive lung disease, pediatric precursors of chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic obstructive lung disorders (asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, aspiration pneumonitis, atelectasis, bronchomalacia and tracheomalacia, immunodeficiency, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, and chronic upper airway obstruction with hypoventilation) are examined.\\n',\n",

The lack of response to zinc supplementation might be explained by the fact that the group of cystic fibrosis subjects studied was fairly healthy in regard to clinical status and certain blood parameters, including zinc.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fecal fat, bile acids, and the rectal microflora were studied in seven control children and in three groups of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  Seven were off antibiotics, ten on oral cloxacillin, and six on i.v. triple therapy (cloxacillin, gentamycin, and carbenicillin) for at least 2 weeks.  Controls had lower concentrations (milligrams per gram dry stool) of both fat (P < 0.005) and vile acids (P < 0.025) than CF children off antibiotics. Antibiotics had little or no effect on fat but led to a striking decrease (P < 0.01) of bile acids in the triple therapy group. Concomitantly, there was reduced deconjugation of bile acids (P < 0.01) and formation of secondary bile acids (P < 0.005).  This was associated with a 5-fold increase in the percentage of bile acids found in the aqueous phase of stools and with a marked reduction (P < 0.001) of the anaerobic flora (log counts per gram wet stool) in children on triple therapy (4.3 plus or minus 1.9) when compared to controls (9.8 plus or minus 0.1), CF off antibiotics (9.1 plus or minus 0.1) and CF on cloxacillin (9.6 plus or minus 0.2).  The close relationship between the anaerobic flora, the extent of bile acid microbial transformation, and fecal bile acid concentrations suggest that reduction of the anaerobic flora decreases adsorption of bile acids to dietary residues and microbes, favors bile acid absorption, and leads to a decreased fecal loss of bile acids in CF.\\n',\n",
       " \"Measurements of serum bile acids (glycine conjugates of cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and lithocholic acids) by radioimmunoassay in a variety of pediatric hepatobiliary disorders showed elevations in neonatal hepatitis syndromes, cholestasis, and hepatitis of extrahepatic or intrahepatic origin. Measurements of individual serum bile acids failed to differentiate between the various neonatal hepatitis syndromes. In one patient with cholestasis, the increased levels of bile acids observed returned to normal following therapy with cholestyramine and phenobarbital. In chronic active hepatitis the serum bile acid values correlated well with the bilirubin and SGOT in response to therapy with corticosteroids. These data confirm suggestions that serum cholylglycine and chenodeoxycholylglycine levels are a sensitive indicator of disturbed hepatic function and can be used in monitoring the course, activity, and therapeutic response in various hepatitis syndromes. In Reye's syndrome and protracted diarrhea of infancy, elevations in serum bile acids were detected without associated hyperbilirubinemia and provided additional evidence of disturbed hepatic function.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The chloride electrode sweat test and gravimetric chloride titration technic are compared. The two technics gave comparable mean values, ogives, equivalent points, and overlap for patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy subjects. As a single test with either technic has an unacceptable risk for false-positive or false-negative results, tests should always be done in pairs. A statistical interpretation technic based on prevalence and technical variability of the two tests will decrease the number of undiagnosed subjects and will define probability of cystic fibrosis in the undiagnosed group.\\n',\n",

We confirm previous reports that salt depletion and metabolic alkalosis do occur throughout the year in the northern United States and England.  When metabolic alkalosis and hypoelectrolytemia in infancy are not explained on the basis of other clinical conditions, CF should be suspected.  Pediatricians should measure serum electrolyte values promptly and consider early parenteral fluid and electrolyte therapy as a preventive measure for infants with CF with persistent vomiting and/or diarrhea.\\n',\n",

Serial measurements of the radius and ulna were made in 27 patients with CF and were compared with 968 age-matched controls. Demineralization was found in 37% of the boys and 63% of the girls. Patients under age 10 years had normal bone mineral content and nine of 15 patients aged 13 or older were demineralized (P less than .01). Demineralization correlated with the extent of weight reduction in patients (P less than .001). Patients most likely to be demineralized were adolescent girls.

       " 'Cystic fibrosis is now the most common cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and of pancreatic insufficiency in the first three decades of life in the United States.  In this report we describe 75 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 18 to 47 years and review another 232 cases reported in the literature.  All of these 307 patients had elevated sweat chloride and sodium levels, which proved excellent discriminants for cystic fibrosis even in patients in the older age group.  COPD, present in 97 per cent, was the major cause of morbidity and mortality, and differed from COPD of other etiologies.  The progressive downhill course in these patients was punctuated by recurrent symptomatic exacerbations of chronic bacterial bronchitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus, and terminated in pulmonary insufficiency, cor pulmonale and death.  COPD was complicated by minor hemoptysis in 60 per cent, massive hemoptysis in 7 per cent and pneumothorax in 16 per cent, problems rare in children.  Sinusitis was present in all those examined roentgenographically, and 48 per cent had nasal polyposis.  Pancreatic insufficiency was present in 95 per cent of the patients, but in contrast to younger patients it was seldom symptomatic although steatorrhea and azotorrhea were still massive. Intussusception and meconium ileus equivalent (fecal accumulation) are frequent in adults (21 per cent) but rare in children, and they require immediate diagnostic and therapeutic intervention with enemas of diatrizoate sodium.  Glycosuria, biliary cirrhosis, cholelithiasis and aspermia were among other complications.  Height and weight were usually within the lower limits of normal, but 17 per cent of the men were above 180 cm in height and 7 per cent were overweight.  Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis, because older patients with cystic fibrosis may look quite well.\\n',\n",
