Metin2 is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) originally developed by Ymir Entertainment (now owned by Webzen Games) and originally released in Korea in 2004.[1] It has since been published in many European countries and in the United States by Gameforge 4D GmbH.[2] Other versions exist in Asian languages.

Gameplay
Experience points are earned every time the player kills enemies or completes a mission from an NPC. The game's combat is based on a hack and slash system. Players can also gather groups of creatures and land basic attacks and skills on each one of them simultaneously while they are all attacking the character at the same time. The game has several different character classes, all of which have 2 different sets of skills they can use, which can also be upgraded.

The in-game currency is called Yang, used to purchase items from the different NPC's. Players can use this to trade with other players or to their own shop. Players can also make their own guild of fighters and guilds can have wars with each other.
