\section{Adopted solutions}

\subsection*{Part A: Clustering}
This part is conducted in an unsupervised approach, with the idea of grouping sentences with clustering algorithms. In particular, we used the \textbf{sklearn} library, with the AgglomerativeClustering class as suggested.\\
The main paths to explore in this part are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data preprocessing:} we decided to clean the data from stopwords and punctuation, to better represent the sentences without the noise that stopwords might add and to resolve issues that could have been caused by typos. 
    \item \textbf{Number of clusters and used metrics: } 
    \item \textbf{Sentences selection: }
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part B: Classification}
