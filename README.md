# Project Title

This is the project repository for Group 8's Information Processing and Retrieval project for the academic year 2023/2024.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on developing an **Information Retrieval (IR) system** for **keyword extraction** and **text summarization** tasks, using the **BBC News Summary dataset**. It is divided into two parts:

### Part 1 (First Delivery)
Unsupervised keyword extraction and text summarization over the document collection, using classic IR querying principles like **TF-IDF** and **BM25**. Key tasks include:

- Indexing
- Ranking sentences
- Handling redundancy
- Evaluating against reference summaries

### Part 2 (Second Delivery)
Exploring clustering techniques for improved summarization, and using supervised learning with reference summaries as feedback. Tasks involve:

- Sentence clustering
- Feature extraction
- Training classifiers
- Assessing the impact of relevance feedback

The project requires implementing various functionalities, such as **indexing**, **summarization**, **keyword extraction**, **evaluation**, **clustering**, **feature extraction**, and **training classifiers**. Students need to experiment with different approaches, handle ranking differences, reduce redundancy, and provide quantitative analysis addressing specific questions posed in the project statement.


### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program

Just open the `ipython` notebook and run the cells in the order they are presented.


## Help

Very slow to run, but it works.
