# Web IR

`Well behaved search`: A search engine that returns relevant results for a query. I think.

Which sites have the same structure? Something like `news`.

`Link dynamics`: Links inside a web that redirects to other web pages in other sites.

## Page Rank

### What is Page Rank

It's an algorithm that estimates the importance of a page.

Imagine having 4 links:

- news
- cooking
- sport
- sport

If you like sport, you will have more probability to get to one of the sport pages. Moreover, from the sport page you have more probabiltiy to get to the other sport page, and not to the cooking or news page.

`Reddit`: Is a good example because Reddit has a lot of links to other pages. We will call it `HUB`, because it's the site you go to find the link to other pages.

## Crawling

`Question`: How to tell if a search engine is good?

`Answer`: If they have a own crawler.

`Crawler`: An agent that uses an algorithm to find websites and decides which one to visit.

#### Google VS Microsoft

Why does Google and Microsoft want you to use their own search engine?

`Data`: They want to collect data for the links you click.
It's good for `link dynamics`.
Google has a lot more data than Microsoft, because they have more users who use their search engine and products.

This is called *User Behavior on the `SERP`* (Search Engine Result Page).

### DuckDuckGo

`DuckDuckGo`: A search engine that doesn't track you.

But does it have a crawler?

`Answer`: Yes, it uses the Bing crawler. So you will get the same results as Bing.

### Some other search engines

- [You](https://you.com): It's a search engine made by one of the best NLP researchers.
- [Kagi](https://kagi.com): A pay to use search engine. They justify it by saying that they will give the best results.
- [Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com): A search engine that doesn't track you.
