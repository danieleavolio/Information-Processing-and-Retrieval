\section{Proposed questions}
In this section, we answer point-to-point to the questions proposed during
project description.

\subsection{Describe the corpus $D$ and summaries $S$. Are terms uniformly distributed regarding TF-IDF?}
Fixed the x axis on terms, it can be seen by the figures that the plotted
distribution of words remains close to unchanged. However, it is important to
note that the y axis has a different scale, due to the smaller cardinality of
the summary set.

\subsection{How does the summarization system perform for the full collection? And within each category? Any intuition for the observed differences?}

\subsection{How IR models affect summaries? How vector space models compare with language models?}
Qua va un attimo contestualizzata la figura
\subsection{Is Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) useful to aid decisions?}
We expected that RRF would help to improve the summaries, since it's a way to
combine the results of different systems and, in machine learning contexts,
ensembles are generally outperforming single models.

Our test was done on the entire collection due to the scarcity of computational
power. Thus, we conduced a test on a subset of the dataset,that shows how the
RRF has no particular difference, with the MAP being worse. \\ STA COSA NON HA
SENSO NON HO CAPITO CHE INTENDI Probably our BERT implementation is not the
best, so probably this can lead to a worse result since the BERT score is
calculated in a way that I'm not sure if it's the best. \\FINE COSA NOSENSO
Moreover, a BERT-based solution is not suggested since the model usage times,
combined with the additional overhead caused by calculating distances in the
latent space, cause a significant slower response.

\subsection{Considering MMR, how $\lambda$ impacts the accuracy (against ideal extracts) of summaries? Should $\lambda$ be a fixed threshold or depend on the provided topic document (d-specific)?}
Qua la figura va rivista, le lambda nell'asse x non corrispondono ai valori
proposti e poi l'asse sembra su un insieme continuo. Ho provato a leggere il
codice, non capisco che sta facendo
\subsection{At the suggested $p$ length threshold, is the system better at promoting recall or precision?}

? che stai provando a dire? \\Every time we try to measure the performance of a system, we always see that the precision is the higest, but the recall is the lowest. This is because the system is trying to avoid to put in the summary a sentence that is not relevant, but this can lead to a lower recall.
